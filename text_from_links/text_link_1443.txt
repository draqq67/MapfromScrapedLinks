Emerging from the groundbreaking West Berlin Gallery and the legendary Stattbad Berlin, OPEN WALLS Gallery was founded as a unique space promoting free expression and public art. It grew into an important landmark for every Urban Art lover and served as a forward-thinking platform for Urban Art, maintaining a focus on urban contemporary, street art and public art movements.
Guillaume Trotin curated the OPEN WALLS program, driven by his passion for Public Art. Concentrating on young emerging talent in the field, the gallery kept a dynamic agenda aiming to excite and inspire. OPEN WALLS became more than a conventional art gallery, it was an experience, a think-tank and the heart of a community.
We trust you enjoyed our program as much as we did!
