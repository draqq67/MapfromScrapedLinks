What our clients have to say
“The guys at Red & Blue are reliable, fast, neat and very competitive on price – a sub-contractor we use over and over again. They are able to service a whole range of projects from single boiler installations to 50+ luxury apartments domestic water, heating and ventilation services. The company director David already has a solution to any problem that may arise throughout the build and as a company director myself they make the stress of running multiple sites far easier to manage. I can concentrate on other duties as they require so little managing. In short, I would recommend them to anyone else looking for a reliable plumbing company.”
— Daniel Pells, Mechanical Director at LEC Group
