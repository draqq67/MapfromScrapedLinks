What our customers are saying
After downloading the FinalDCP FREE Edition and creating our first DCP within 3 hours, it became clear we can create DCPs on our own using FinalDCP. A few days later we bought FinalDCP and 3 days later screened our first DCP for a festival. Timm and Axel were super responsive, giving instant feedback on all questions or helped us with understanding problems.
We now have created more than 10 DCPs in various cut versions, so FinalDCP saved us more than it costs.
Thanks to the FinalDCP team for this easy and robust option for inhouse DCP creation.
Martin Weisz
