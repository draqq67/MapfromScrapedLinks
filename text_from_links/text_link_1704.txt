Jon and his team recently renovated my website and the whole experience was superb. Very easy to deal with and they were more than happy to implement any changes we needed post completion. The website is really easy to navigate and has the aesthetic look we wanted to match our branding and ethos. Highly recommend using Brave Bear Marketing for all website and advertising needs. Will use again 100%

We have used Brave Bear Marking for many years and we simply wouldn't go anywhere else - they are always our first stop for website and email hosting, and creating new websites. Their personal contact and speedy response is priceless.
