  WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY
''Fraser and Classic Hand Tools are a credit to the craft. Hands down the best customer service I've received; they are always patient and accommodating, no matter my enquiry (and I've made many). They will always be my first port of call when the shop needs a new addition.''

''Great customer service - emailed me the day after my enquiry about flexcut chisels (4 other sellers didn’t bother to reply at all!). I’ve bought what they recommended and shipped next day. Price was great too. Can’t fault that! Highly recommend and I’ll be buying from them again soon.''

''I ordered some beautiful scribing tools that still work precisely despite the long journey to Germany. Goods were very well packaged! Unfortunately there were problems with the shipping service, but Alex from Classic Hand Tools looked after me very well and arranged everything to ensure that the goods ended up with me. Big praise to the customer support, you won't find such commitment anywhere else. Thank you!''
