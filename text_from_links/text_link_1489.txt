WELCOME TO MY HOME
Hello there! My name is Codydawg and I'm a passionate costume performer from the Ruhr district in Germany. More precisely I'm a so-called fursuiter, which means I like to play self-invented animal characters at events and conventions. I also like to create things on the web, host entertaining events for other fursuiters and publish still or moving pictures from time to time. Choose one of the four hubs above to begin your epic journey. Enjoy!
