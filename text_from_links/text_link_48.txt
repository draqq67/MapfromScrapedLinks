About Us
Albert Borokhim was born of Iranian descent from a family with a deep and honorable history in the rug business in Iran. He immigrated to the U.S. over 50 years ago to go to school at the University of Wisconsin in Madison for Engineering.
After falling in love with Madison, Albert was eventually persuaded by friends and family to open his signature store. His first store opened on Monroe Street in 1972. A favorite neighborhood for Madisonians, Monroe Street became an even more interesting neighborhood with the great rugs Albert was able to bring into the area. No longer did people have to purchase the run of the mill quality rugs and flooring, they could finally have rugs rich in tradition, heritage, and quality.
With an heirloom quality collection, Borokhim rugs became a staple for people who wanted to purchase unique and often rare rugs from around the world.
Albert Borokhim welcomes you into his personal collection of high-end handmade rugs from around the world, and hopes that you and your family will enjoy them as much as he has. High quality rugs last for generations with ease, so please understand that when you are purchasing a rug here, you are purchasing something that will be enjoyed by your family for years to come.
