Certikin Mini Pumps
26 April 2024  |  Denise
Had an urgent order for a Certikin Mini Pump and the staff at PoolMarket were fantastic.
They managed to sort my order out really quick and I received the pump the next day.
Even though Dave was out of the office he did his best to keep in contact and ensure this got sorted for me.
Many thanks to a great team
