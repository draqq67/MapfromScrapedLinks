SOLAR IS EDUCATION

It is hard to believe that 600 million people in Africa don’t have access to energy, especially if you’re someone who lives in a world where electricity is available at the flick of a switch. Energy is not just a convenient resource; energy powers lives and creates opportunities. It allows communities to thrive and economies to grow. It powers imagination and allows people to realize their dreams. And with clean energy, the earth thrives as well. 
By working with communities, businesses, civil society, and governments, Little Sun delivers affordable clean energy solutions to those who need it most. Solar energy enables children to study at night. Farmers can irrigate their fields and process crops to increase yields. In remote areas, doctors can treat patients and deliver life-saving vaccines. Mothers can give birth safely at night. Entrepreneurs can start and grow businesses.
“Bringing solar energy to
everyone is simple:
It starts with you.
Let’s take the power
of the future into our
own hands.”
Olafur Eliasson
