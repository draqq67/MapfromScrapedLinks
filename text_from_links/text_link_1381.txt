THE HAGGIS HORNS FEAT. DOC BROWN
TAKE IT BACK (CMC&SILENTA REMIX)
UK funk/soul legends The Haggis Horns are bouncing back now with a series of remixes of tracks from their previous albums on Haggis Records.Now comes a second remix, this time via Germany's top hip-hop/breakbeat producers/remixers CMC & Silenta from Roca Records.
  They've given an electro twist to the original old school hip-hop/funk track "Take It Back" from the 2017 album "One Of These Days" which featured guest UK MC Doc Brown. The original rap is still there as are the backing vocals, funk guitar licks, The Haggis Horns' legendary brass section and trombone and sax solos. They've swapped the live funk drums and bass for a four-to-the-floor funky electro boogie shuffle that will boom from club and festival speakers once we're back to dancing together again.
A nice club-friendly version of "Take It Back" that could definitely crossover from the funk/soul community into the electronic music scene with ease. It's good to have The Haggis Horns back once again releasing music and finding new followers beyond their traditional fan base. Something they've always done since day one - refused to stand still - and that's the reason that 20 years since their first gigs, they're still here and relevant. Long may it continue.

FIVE ALARM FUNK FEAT. BOOTSY COLLINS
WE PLAY THE FUNK (CMC&SILENTA REMIX)
RELASE DATE: April 2nd 2021
  5AF teamed up with funk legend Bootsy Collins for this hit. With Bootsy's unmistakable voice and bass line and Five Alarm Funk's exceptional groove and horn section, "We Play The Funk" became an homage to the genre. CMC & Silenta in their unique style used the parts of the song to produce a driving anthem.
The rhythms of the horn section are supported by unique percussion and then explode in the main part with the driving creaky bass and dry drums. The final touch is the powerful "We Play The Funk" vocal with the trademark sound of Bootsy Collins.
