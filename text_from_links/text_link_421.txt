 Kimberly: Great little museum! Visited with my boys, 8 and 6, while camping at Kanopolis. We spent 3 hrs here and only 3 because they were closing! The tornado exhibit is really cool and was enjoyed by all 3 of us. My 8 yr old loved the log cabin. Definitely recommend stopping if you're in the area!
