Top 5 Tips for Studying in the UK
Young Learners Programme!
Available for students aged 16 - 17 years old.
Returning in 2024, the Young Learners Homestay Programme for students aged 16-17 provides more autonomy than the junior programme. Students can enjoy the independence offered to adult students, whilst taking part in full day excursions and optional activities. Students can stay in either residence or homestay accommodation during their time at ETC. All our homestays are DBS checked and inspected regularly, whilst students staying in residence accommodation are safe and secure with CCTV and staff safeguarding on-site 24/7.
