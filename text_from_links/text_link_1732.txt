Our retreats come in many different forms. You can come alone, organise your own group,  stay overnight or book in to one of our organised retreats. Whatever you need, it’s here for you at the Retreat House. 
Chaplains
We have a team of chaplains who come in daily to lead morning prayer at 9.15a.m and midday prayer at 12 noon. and they are also available for anyone who wishes to meet with a chaplain during their retreat Monday to Friday. 
The chaplains are a team of people consisting of both lay and ordained people; they are available for prayer and spiritual direction if required. For more information please contact Revd Sharon Guest.
