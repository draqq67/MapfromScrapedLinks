GET TO KNOW US
WHAT WE DO
We start by listening. This helps us to fully understand your business needs and goals. As your marketing consultants, we sometimes ask difficult questions to get under the skin of your business. Based on that, we help you develop your vision and strategy for the future. Only then do we choose the most suitable promotional tools that we know will make a difference to your bottom line.
MEDIA RELATIONS
Quality media coverage of you and your business - be it online, radio, TV, newspaper or magazine - aimed at your target audience has a highly credible, long lasting impact.
DIGITAL MARKETING
A well developed and regularly updated digital presence is essential; our services include social media marketing and paid advertising on platforms including Facebook and Instagram.
STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT
Do you know where your business is heading? Are you leading it, or is it leading you? Mapping the future and what you want to achieve will help fulfil your business aspirations.
EVENT PLANNING
Digitally or in-person, bringing your target audience together to sample your product or service and meet you and your team will yield higher sales and long-term customer relationships.
CONTENT MARKETING
Quality content is key to increased brand visibility. It helps bind your customers to you and your business before they buy. Your website, blogs, videos, tutorials, third party materials are all part of that.
WEB MARKETING - SEO
Having a lovely website is pointless if it isn't visible to your target audience. It's essential that your website is found as close to the top of page one of Google as possible. We help you get there.
