"Putting was fabulous on Sunday particularly, played really well, 2 under on Sunday. Thanks for helping me out - it certainly made the difference. Had to hole from 5 feet to get into a playoff - and I actually felt confident over it - great feeling! Thanks again - I'll be back!!"

ABOUT US
Our golf course was designed and built by its proprietor Phil Taylor an FPGA Professional since 1980 who developed the Golf Centre to provide the best pay and play facilities in Surrey and give access for all standards of golfer from a new beginner through to an established player. His philosophy has always been to provide a complete facility for golfers of all ages and standards to enjoy within a friendly and Professional environment.
Aiming to make golf available to all and having had young family himself Phil understands the demands of modern family life and has always strived to offer value for money 'no strings attached golf' that can be done in one to two hours. Working on the 'two hour window' Phil developed a 6 hole Golf Course format that can fit into a busy family schedule, opening up the possibility to play and practice more often in smaller time frames. A place to enjoy with or without the family! For information on Opening Times click here.
