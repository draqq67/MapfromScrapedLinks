INVESTMENT STRATEGY
WE INVEST
IN OUTSTANDING TEAMS
Venista Ventures backs ambitious founders with visionary ideas facing the challenges of today and tomorrow. Therefore, we invest quite broadly into a variety of verticals, always aiming to be among the first investors in the startups we support.
Apparently we are not the traditional VC fund. Having been founders ourselves, we truly understand the challenges of scaling a company. We’ve had successes but also failures, which both led to valuable lessons learned. That’s why we see ourselves as engaged sparring partners, especially when it comes to online marketing, B2B sales and recruiting efforts. Besides our startup portfolio, the Venista Ventures group also includes two fully-owned and operating subsidiaries which are operating as agencies.
If you like how we work and match our investment criteria, we are more than pleased to hear more about your idea. Submit your pitch here.
