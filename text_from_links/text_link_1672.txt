Brighton copywriter Jools Stone
Hi there and welcome to the virtual abode of me, Mr Jools Octavius Stone, a Brighton-based copywriter, journalist, travel writer, blogger, marketing consultant, music writer, train travel connoisseur, bon vivant and all round good egg. What can I help you with today?
Journalism
As well as being an experienced copywriter, content strategist and marketing professional, I’m also a professionally-trained journalist with over 18 years’ experience of writing for a wide variety of publications and audiences.
My byline has appeared in many well-known publications, including the Telegraph, the Guardian, The New European, the Daily Express, the Scotsman, the Sunday Times Travel Magazine, Rough Guides, the List, Electronic Sound Magazine, Club Life Magazine and many more.
Copywriting
Copywriting and content clients include London City Airport, Great Western Railway, Club Med, Holiday Hypermarket, National Trust for Scotland, Tesco, CRBE Property, Clydesdale Bank, Scottish Power, Heathrow Airport and Picture Book Films, to name just a handful.
Social Media & Content Strategy
I was an enthusiastic early adopter of social media, which has helped me build a reasonable and engaged following across multiple platforms, which I’ve maintained to this day.
My client work is always on-brief, on-message and on-time. Every time.
My key specialisms are travel (especially rail and business travel), arts, property and music.
Feel free to give me a call on the good, old fashioned dog and bone: 07804 151654
