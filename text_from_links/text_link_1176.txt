Glycan excellence against cancer
About Us

Tacalyx was founded in 2019 as a spin-out of the Max-Planck-Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (MPICI) in Potsdam, Germany.
We strive to develop novel anticancer therapeutics targeting Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs).

Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs)
TACAs are attractive targets for novel immunotherapeutics against human cancers. Many TACAs are expressed during embryonic development but not under physiologic conditions in differentiated tissues. On tumors, in contrast, TACAs show very high expression levels, allowing to bring more therapeutic agents to the cancer cell.
Pipeline

Our pipeline comprises several first-in-class assets targeting different TACAs across multiple solid human cancers.
Assets in our pipeline are amenable to various treatment modalities, including antibody-drug conjugates, T cell engagers and others.
