Positively Transforming
Communities in Cincinnati
Three Points Brewery • Broadway Square
At The Model Group, we’re working every day to positively transform communities in these ways:
1
By revitalizing vacant & blighted urban blocks into high quality mixed-use communities
2
By developing high impact affordable housing with non-profit owners and service providers.
3
By building for owners with a Partnership Approach to General Contracting
