DRIVE EFFICIENCIES WITH TRANSPORT LOGISTICS DATA
Monthly data guides process improvement around organ and team transport.
Our partners have access to a monthly dashboard that tells the story of recent missions through data that shows how requests were received, where teams and shipments traveled, and the cold ischemic time (CIT) of all transported organs based on information received by Trinity. This actionable data can help organizations drive efficiencies, reduce costs and, ultimately, increase access to organs for transplant.
