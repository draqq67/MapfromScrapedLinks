Take a guided Duck ride of the Lower Dells aboard a Original World War II-era Dells Army Duck! The Ducks have been one of Wisconsin Dells’ most popular Wisconsin Dells attraction for 70+ years, and they provide a sightseeing experience unlike any other. Discover sandstone rock formations that are over 14,000 years old such as Grotto Island, the Twin Ink Stands, Sugar Bowl, and Lone Rock. Two Splash Downs into Sasquatch Lake and use the Duck’s six-wheel drive capabilities to traverse Dell Creek. Our 55 minute, land-and-water Duck rides has been the most unique and original way to experience the Wisconsin Dells for over 70 years.
The Dells were created at the end of the last glacial period from the flood waters of the Wisconsin River ripping through soft sandstone that was once the floor of a prehistoric sea. The raging river managed to carve the gorges, caves, rocky islands and towering cliffs which would come to be admired for centuries. Visitors have been coming to the Wisconsin Dells to take-in the natural wonders for generations, and a guided boat tour aboard one of our amphibious Ducks provides an experience your family won’t soon forget!
During the summer months, Dells Army Ducks depart every 30 minutes daily for a 55 minute duck boat tour. All duck boat tours are guided through the Lower Dells of the Wisconsin River, exposing you up close to one-of-a-kind rock formations. Visit our Photo Gallery to see historic photos and tour images. It’s fun, entertaining and a must-do when visiting Wisconsin Dells!
