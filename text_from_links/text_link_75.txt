The beautiful staff at the McClinton Cancer Center that cared for my mom during her fight.
My cancer diagnosis was devastating for me. I'm trying to stay positive during my treatment and many doctor appointments. I met Dawn with Hugs For Healings. What a light she has been for me. I received a port pal from her initially. Recently during one of my recent treatments at the McClinton Center, she delivered a Blessings Bag to me. It was full of items a cancer patient can use. It was put together with thoughtfulness and love by such a caring person. Thank you Dawn for lifting my spirits and for patients like me.
