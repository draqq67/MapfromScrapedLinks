Located just 20 minutes from the heart of Birmingham city centre this huge woodland Multi Activity Center includes Paintball, Knife /Axe throwing., Archery, Target Shooting, Gelblaster and Airsoft!

Our park has a selection of the country's most exciting game zones to battle it out in. As well as traditional woodland war zones to blast your way round, the site's also home to an urban town and an abandoned military convoy to capture the full battle experience.

My 15 year old son and his friends had an excellent afternoon with these guys. Fresh air, exercise and paintballing your mates - what's not to like!

Easy to arrange both on the phone and on the website. Well-organised on site and fast set-up. Guys were great with our group of 15 year olds who all thoroughly enjoyed it. Great way to get them out running around in the fresh air!
