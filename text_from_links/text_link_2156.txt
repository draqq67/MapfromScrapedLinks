Welcome to the Puget Sound Limited's
If you own a '73 and older special interest vehicle and would like to be a part of a fun group of folks Please come join us!
The Puget Sound Limitedâ€™s club was started in 1976 with just a few enthusiastic members. Now with 20+ members and their families, we share stories, events and ideas for preserving vehicles. Our goal is to maintain a family-oriented club, while promoting enthusiasm for the sport.
The club was initially for 53-56 F-100 trucks and panels. Now the club membership is open to 73 and older special interest vehicles of all makes and models.
Mission Statement:
The mission of this non-profit organization is to:
1. Form a group of fellow owners who share a common interest in preserving and restoring special interest vehicles.
2. Enjoy family type activities, e.g. camp outs, picnics, rod runs, swap meets, garage visits, etc.
3. Provide support to local charities
