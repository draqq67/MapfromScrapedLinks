I love building
websites
My passion is designing and building websites and doing email marketing to help drive traffic. I also like to check out the stats to see what I can do to build better faster websites.
MY WORK
My Designs are for Mobile Plaforms, too.
I use frameworks like Zurb Foundaiton or Bootstrap to build responsive and robust websites that can scale to any size browser or device. I also have built apps using Ionic to so I can deploy to both iPhone and Android devices, which is a great new experience.
MY WORK
My Process & Workflow.
My process and work flows weather solo or on a team is to collaborate with the client or stake holder and start getting the ideas together to research competitors in the market. Then the planning starts.
Following the plan being put together we start creating Wireframes for content and design. This helps the smooth the plans when we start designing and devolping the product.
