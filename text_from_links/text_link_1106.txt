THE LOUISIANA CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE LIVING
The Louisiana Campaign for Tobacco-Free Living (TFL) engages in local and state wide tobacco control policy efforts that focus on tobacco prevention, eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke, promote cessation services, and identify and eliminate tobacco-related disparities.
WE WORK TO IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE TOBACCO CONTROL INITIATIVES THAT CAN REDUCE AND PREVENT THE USE OF TOBACCO, AS WELL AS ELIMINATE EXPOSURE TO SECONDHAND SMOKE.
