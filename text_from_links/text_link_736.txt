Learn more about What We Do
Our work with Brown-Forman is a great example
of how our process works in real life.
Brown-Forman asked us to help them develop a clear, comprehensive strategy for environmental sustainability. After assessing the current state of their culture, we helped design a strategy to meet their goals. Once that strategy was approved, we created a Roadmap, outlining a step-by-step approach to help them measure progress and outcomes along the way.
The results?
Three years in to the implementation of their Roadmap, they reported the following results: 
30% reduction in energy, waste water and carbon emissions 
85% reduction in waste to landfill 
First time cross-functional employee engagement focused on sustainability
Rob Frederick, the VP & Director, Corporate Brand and Communications | Brown-Forman Corporation had this to say about our work: 
Kathy and her team’s work with Brown-Forman in the early days of deepening and advancing our sustainability commitment helped put us on a path to better understand and leverage culture, purpose and employee engagement. Like a fine cocktail, Miller Consultants provides just the right mix of thought leadership, research, guidance and tools to accelerate sustainability progress.”
