MimiVax Granted Fast Track Designation from FDA for SurVaxM for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
MimiVax announced today that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) to MimiVax’s SurVaxM vaccine being studied for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM).
“The receipt of Fast Track Designation affirms the importance of new clinical developments of novel therapies to improve the treatment and outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma,” said Michael Ciesielski, CEO of MimiVax. “This designation is a key component in our journey to help patients with glioblastoma to live longer.”
Enhanced access to the FDA including opportunities for more frequent meetings and direct consultation .
Drugs with FTD are eligible to apply for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review at the time of a New Drug Application (NDA) submission.
FTD also allows for a ‘rolling review’ in which MimiVax may submit completed sections of the SurVaxM NDA as they become available, rather than at the end development.

MimiVax Announces Positive Final Data from the Phase 2A Study of SurVaxM for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Published Today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology
The current study found that 51% of nGBM patients receiving SurVaxM had survived at least 2 years and 41% had survived 3 years, considerably higher rates than has been seen historically from standard care.
MimiVax is pleased to announce the published manuscript of the now completed Phase 2A study of SurVaxM, a cancer vaccine, in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM) in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, authored by researchers from several prominent US cancer centers. 
 A follow-up Randomized, Blinded Placebo-Controlled Phase 2B Clinical trial of SurVaxM for nGBM (SURVIVE) [NCT05163080] is now recruiting at 10 cancer centers
across the USA.
