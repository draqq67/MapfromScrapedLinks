Welcome to the PMK Civil Engineering Website
PMK Civil Engineering Limited was formed in November 2002 to service civil engineering works within the Utilities Industry, and undertook Telecom, Power, Water, Street Lighting and Gas Contracts from the outset.
The Company currently employs 100 Personnel, which includes fully qualified Office staff, as well as experienced, accredited external Manual operatives.
The Main Office is located in Glasgow, close to the M8 and A77 and only 45 minutes drive from Edinburgh, which allows for convenient servicing of customers throughout Scotland.
With the continued growth of the Company, various major Projects are now being undertaken throughout the UK. The most recent success being our appointment to the prestigious SPEN Framework Agreement for Cable Laying in May 2012.
PMK attained accreditation to the ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 Management Systems within 7 months of its inception in July 2003.
