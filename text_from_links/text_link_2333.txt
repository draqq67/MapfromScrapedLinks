WELCOME TO THE CLARENDON HOTEL IN BLACKHEATH
A warm welcome is waiting – at the heart of the Village
Our doors are always open. Come and stay with us, or visit for Afternoon Tea, lunch or dinner – or our famous Sunday Roast.
With uninterrupted views of Blackheath towards Royal Greenwich Park, this Georgian Hotel is both grand and welcoming with its relaxed yet efficient style.
Our location simply couldn’t be better for walking into Greenwich, or taking a short train journey from nearby Blackheath station into central London (London Bridge to Blackheath is just a 12 minute journey).
Or you can stroll around Blackheath Village with its wealth of independent shops, bars and eateries, relax in our gardens or take afternoon tea in our restaurant to unwind.
The Clarendon is the only starred hotel in Blackheath and we have a range of beautiful rooms to choose from, including luxurious suites perfect for a romantic getaway as well as rooms to sleep the whole family.
We are independently owned and run, with excellent standards of service and attention to detail – and we are one of the few London hotels with its own car parking free of charge on a first come, first served basis.
Our teams are well-equipped, well-trained and The Clarendon Hotel Blackheath London is, as always, ready to extend a very warm welcome to you.
We’d love to see you – At The Heart of The Village.
