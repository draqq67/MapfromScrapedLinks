WELCOME TO
THORNTON LODGE
LUXURIOUS AND TRANQUIL
Wensleydale's 5 Star Country House Escape
Located close to Hawes and Aysgarth Falls, in the Yorkshire Dales National Park, Thornton Lodge, built in 1909 as a holiday home for wealthy industrialists, has been our home since 2004 and welcomed guests since 2006. Set in large private grounds in open countryside along a quiet lane, Thornton Lodge provides a peaceful haven amid fine period features and modern comforts. Guests enjoy watching the wildlife in the garden, ranging from the occasional deer, red squirrel or badger to plentiful rabbits, free ranging hens and the robotic lawnmower! 
Please check out our rooms if you're looking for a relaxed stay in very agreeable, child free surroundings. From the high quality sprung beds, egyptian cotton bedding, white company toiletries, varied in room hot drink choices, modern ensuite bathrooms and tasteful decor you can   easily see why this has remained one of North Yorkshires highest rated getaways. Add to that the large rooms, reasonable rates, beautiful setting, genuinely warm welcome and delicious breakfasts complete with fab homemade preserves I love making, along with free range eggs from my pet hens and there really is no reason not to give us a try.  We're also surrounded by an abundance of different villages with great places to eat out at on an evening. I'm not licensed, but provide fridges, glasses and bottle openers in each room so please feel free to bring your own drinks to enjoy at the house. I have a lovely large guest lounge and orangery for guests to relax in.

Please do use this website to book online as it has the best rates and availability, with a Â£10 per night difference against the rates charged on booking.com. You're also welcome to email me to ask questions and it's always nice to speak to people too. However you choose to book, I'd be delighted to welcome you to Thornton Lodge, to experience one of Yorkshire's finest luxury five star bed and breakfast holiday destinations, set in beautiful grounds in open countryside. Please note, it isn't possible to bring your dog to stay at the house with you.
My 2023 season ended in September and I am closed until Friday 31st May 2024. My last night for guests in the 2024 season will be Saturday 21st September.
