Our Close Protection Services
Intelligent Protection International Limited provides Close Protection Bodyguards and Executive Protection Services to meet our clients' requirements, whether it is in a hostile environment, or a capital city. We operate with an amalgamation of professional standards, great management and highly experienced personnel.
Incorporated in 2009 and part of Intelligent (UK Holdings) Limited group of companies, with our Head Office in the English Cotswolds, we have offices in London, UK Genève, Switzerland, New York and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Further to this, in 2017, Intelligent Protection International Limited became the first UK Close Protection provider to have an official office in France and be registered with CNAPS, the French Security Licensing authority.
Risk and Threat
Our Close Protection Services are diverse and tailored to our clients' needs. We understand the balance between business and family life, and the need to fit around the client whilst giving the best protection possible. Part of understanding their needs often involves a Security Review and Security Risk Assessment.
Our experience in providing Specialist Close Protection and Executive Protection Services is second to none; our Bodyguard Operatives are former members of British Military, Special Forces (SAS/SBS) or are from a Royal Protection or Intelligence background.
In addition to our Close Protection Bodyguard Services, Intelligent Protection International Limited also has a number of Technical Support Personnel and Specialist Driving Officers to support any Executive Protection or Bodyguard task worldwide.
From two Close Protection Bodyguards, to a full Close Protection Team with supplemented services, or bilingual Bodyguards, please contact us to discuss your requirements. Our “how to hire a Bodyguard” guide may prove very helpful if you have never hired a Bodyguard before. See: How to Hire a Bodyguard

To aid both our clients and our services, we now offer Travel Advice free of charge.
