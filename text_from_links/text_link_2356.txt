Notice of Resuming Sales and Distribution Globally
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has issued an order on April 16, 2024, effective immediately, that stays the contempt sanctions of the worldwide sales injunction, the worldwide notice requirement, and the further accumulation of $1-million-per-day fines. As a result, Hytera and all of its officers, agents, servants, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, and distributors and resellers of any type, and all those persons in active concert or participation with any of them, may now resume their regular business activities.
