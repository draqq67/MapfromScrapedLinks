SHREWSBURY FARMERS MARKET every 1st Friday of the month
At Great Berwick we specialise in rearing English Longhorn cattle and producing some of the finest beef possible.  So whether you're looking for Longhorn Beef, Beef which has been raised purely on a grass diet (Pasture for Life Association), Organic Beef (certified by Organic Farmers & Growers), dry aged Beef (on the hook for 35 days) Beef with a guaranteed provenance, Local Beef or Beef online .... we supply all of this and more.
Reared on the fields next to the River Severn, just upstream from the market town of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, our herd of Longhorns, with their majestic horns, live a relaxed, stress free existence. The calves stay with their mums until they're ready to be weaned at 9 months old and we then allow them to mature slowly and naturally under our care.
The welfare of all our livestock is and will always be, our highest priority. The soil and the natural biodiversity above and below ground are our greatest assets and we farm in the most environmentally and sustainable way in order to protect these precious and fragile resources.  
Using our own on farm cold room facilities the whole carcass is hung on the bone, to dry age, for up to 35 days to allow the meat to further tenderise and develop a rich dark flavour. The intermuscular marbling throughout the meat occurs as a result of slow growth and it's a reliable indicator of quality. These simple, back to basic, factors yield beef which is tender and full of flavour.
We strive to produce the very best Beef and we want to share it with you.
We look forward to hearing from you

 'The topside we bought from you was magnificent and certainly the bone marrow we added to the order enhanced out home made gravy. The joint was tender and truely superior to anything I've had before. Your attention to customer service throughout the order process was excellent. Your commitment to the herds care clearly enhanced the quality of the product'
