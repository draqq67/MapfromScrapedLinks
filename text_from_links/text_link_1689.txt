This is a very impactful video. It was well made and we should use it widely. I‚Äôd be keen for the whole Senior Leadership Team to have seen it.

I can‚Äôt recommend Sort Of‚Ä¶Films enough!! They made the most sensitive and impactful film about my research helping Syrian refugees in Jordan to grow food. The resulting film was stunning. I can‚Äôt imagine working with anyone else for our films in the future.

Hello and welcome to Sort Of‚Ä¶Films
We are a highly experienced, energetic and client-focused video production company offering reliable, creative, cost-effective, broadcast quality video content services for clients across sectors including higher education, health, infrastructure, manufacturing and the public sector.
Working from our studio base in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, we‚Äôve travelled the world for a vast array of organisations and brands and built long term client relationships that continue to go from strength to strength.
As filmmakers, our approach is down-to-earth, flexible, open, innovative and collaborative and we‚Äôre able to help with the complete range of film production, video, documentary and animation communications that businesses and organisations need.
You might require an end to end service which involves research, development, scripting, production, post-production and assistance with distribution. Alternatively, you may just need a camera operator, help with some video editing, motion graphics, training, voiceovers or access to production facilities.
We have a particular interest in stories and video projects which support or promote sustainability and social and environmental justice, education and equality.
We also offer aerial video, photography, event videography, corporate video, marketing, social media and video strategy and if you‚Äôre here because you want to use video to promote or celebrate an event, a product, a business or a service, you‚Äôre in the right place. üôÇ
