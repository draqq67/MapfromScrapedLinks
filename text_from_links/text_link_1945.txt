Welcome to my tile shop!
Maria Starling Design is the result of a collaboration between myself and the skilled artisans that allow me to turn my vision into reality.
We sell a mixture of both Moroccan cement tiles, porcelain tiles and hand made ceramic wall tiles. With every tile being designed in house and carefully hand made to give you stunning results with contemporary, original tile designs.
I hope you, like me, love the look and feel of hand made products and will embrace the tiny differences and imperfections that are inherent in them. Every tile has character and personality, a welcome relief from the mass produced ‘perfection’ of modern production methods.
This tile range is fuelled by a passion for all things, handmade, well made for seekers of a considered vibrant lifestyle.
I look forward to helping you choose your perfect tile and can’t wait to see what you do with them!

Designed with love, from me to you!
Hello and welcome! I'm Maria, a tile and rug designer, happily based in Norfolk.

Starting out as a mosaic artist, I have worked alongside some of the top artists in London on commissions both at home and abroad, as well as running my own mosaic studio.
After discovering the cement tiles made in Morocco some years ago, I started designing patterned tiles in that medium, eventually expanding to ceramic tiles and porcelain tiles as well. My bold and modern designs offer a wonderful contemporary style, with a strong identity, rooted in my love and knowledge of pattern and colour.
My cement tiles are stunning to look at, smooth underfoot, yet hard wearing and practical, they can grace both floors and walls in bathrooms, kitchens and hallways, for residential or commercial use.
Happy browsing! and do contact us directly with any enquiries X
