How We Help

Unified Inbox For Multiple Channels
You can handle all of your customer interactions through one unified inbox. Chat, Email, Social Media, reviews and Messaging conversations (and Voice via our partners) are all routed real-time and handled in one unique interface. AI based Bots take care of the repetitive questions leaving your agents with a unified inbox that has been designed for fast and reactive customer care. With the messaging first feel, gone are the old impersonal and transactional email and chat ticket systems.  All channels become a messaging first experience, better for your customers and better for your team.

Group Channel Management
Manage Social Messaging channels like Facebook and Twitter (public and private) , web chat, and Messenger channels like Line in shared inboxes, and automatically load balance conversations across your online team and never miss a customer query or opportunity.




Shared Visibility
You can view which of your team mates are online, how their own assigned conversations are going, and your supervisors and team managers can view the entire queue, who's working on what, and analyse unresolved conversations across all channels, including those falling behind service level agreement.

Slash Response Time And Scale 300% Using The Same Team Resource With Automation

Automatic Routing By SLA And Priority
The Sentiment automatic routing engine takes all incoming conversations irrespective of channel and routes them to your online team mates based on internally set priorities or service level targets. Your team mates never get to cherry pick which queries they want to deal with, so issues are not missed, and response times are greatly reduced. You can either scale back on human resource, or triple your revenue with the same team.
Automatic Classification
The Sentiment automation engine can carry out a whole series of defined events specific to your organisation. For instance spam is automatically classified and removed from queues, issues can be tagged by type with smart labels based on keywords, location, channel. Even remove profanities automatically from your public social accounts and many many more automations making your team more efficient and effictive, and your customers and prospects serviced far faster.
