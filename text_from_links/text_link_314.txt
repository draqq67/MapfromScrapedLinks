We’re not just a food business, we’re a family business.
When Tony and his wife Cyndi founded Ynot in 1993, the decision was made to put Tony’s name on every location and box of food they prepared (YNOT is TONY spelled backwards – a throwback to his childhood nickname). Using Tony’s name was their testament to the relentless commitment they have to high quality, hand-crafted food.
When Tony’s brother Harry joined the company, their shared childhood experience of cooking alongside their Italian parents and grandparents unveiled not only their love of good food and authentic Italian flavors, but also time spent with family around the dinner table.
Whether you’re dining-in or ordering-out, we’ve made your food with the same quality and care we would make for our own family, so that you can enjoy it with yours!
