VINCENT MOTORCYCLE PARTS
Vincent Motorcycles was a British made motorcycle manufactured from 1928 to 1955 with the “V” twin engines.  The business was established by Philip Vincent who bought the name HRD from an existing supplier. Some of the larger engine Vincents were capable of 125 MPH. Manufacturing operations ceased in 1959.  However, the brand lives on as one of the most prestigious British bikes ever made and we offer quality British made parts for Vincent Motorcycles for the Rapide, Comet, Black Shadow & Meteor models.  Many of the parts we supply are still made in Meridian Works in Coventry and hence the parts are as originally fitted to the Vincent Motorcycles.
We also supply a comprehensive range of original Vincents Riders Manuals, Service Manuals, and spare parts books which are Ex Coventry Works.
