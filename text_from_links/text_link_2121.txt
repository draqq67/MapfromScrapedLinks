    Beautifully handmade soft furnishings
Welcome to Simply Sewing — a small business based near Wokingham in Berkshire. I specialise in all types of handmade soft furnishings. I am happy to provide a free estimate including a visit to measure your windows and advice on curtain and blind styles.
Curtains
I can make all types of curtains to order - lined, unlined or interlined. I can also create coordinating tiebacks, pelmets and valances. In addition, I provide the necessary lining, tape and other sundries.
Blinds
There are many styles of blinds available including Roman, London, festoon, reefed or tie-up. I can supply all the necessary materials; all you need to do is choose the fabric.
Soft Furnishings
As well as curtains and blinds, I can make coordinating cushions, bedcovers, lined baskets, headboards and lampshades.
Fabrics and Poles
I have a selection of sample books which you can browse at home. I offer a range of hand finished wooden and wrought iron poles.
I hold an NOCN level 3 Diploma in Professional Curtain Making and Soft Furnishing.
