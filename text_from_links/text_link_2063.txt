CELEBRATING SARDINIA TOUR‚ÄîThe Festa di Sant'Antioco opens with the procession of the sacred bread.

For days women have been preparing the decorated bread. Now we watch as they gather in their traditional costumes, wearing humble wooden clogs, to walk to the basilica and lay their handiwork at the feet of the effigy of Sant'Antioco, patron saint of Sardinia. One woman carries her baby. Never too young to celebrate.

Witness this yourself on our tour next year: https://www.sapori-e-saperi.com/celebrating-sardinia.html

Here's Kevin holding the salami he made under Ismaele Turri's guidance, and here's what he wrote about the salumi course:

"We all sit around and dream of travel like we see from Anthony Bourdain or Stanley Tucci, yet our own trips never quite deliver that same sense of authenticity and access. Well, Erica has solved that! The level of access to the artisans that we had in our Advanced Salumi course in Tuscany was amazing - we worked hand in hand with norcini to produce wonderful salumi that we ate and they sold. It went well beyond a cooking class - the norcini brought us into not only their businesses but also their homes to share their crafts with us. Food lovers of all kinds will appreciate this type of course and the diverse participants in it, ranging from professional butchers to home producers to those who were simply along for the ride. We learned not only from the norcini but from each other as well."

Thank you, Kevin üß° And thank you to all our artisans who make our courses such authentic experiences üíöüíöüíö

REMEMBER:
What counts isn't whether the glass is half full or half empty.
What counts is how many bottles are left!
