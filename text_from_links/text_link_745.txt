WaterWays is devoted to clean water in the Caribbean Basin (dba CaribbeanSEA).
We run camps and educational programs in both areas to empower kids and communities to protect and restore their water where they live, work, and play.
Our goal is to help achieve clean water for all.
ABOUT US
We collaborate with agencies in the Caribbean to teach children about their connection with nature and to empower them to lead, protect, and restore their environment.
