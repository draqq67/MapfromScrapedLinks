The Volusia County Medical Society
Is dedicated to bringing the physicians of Volusia County into one organization, promoting the science and art of medicine, and fostering the common interest of our members and the public.
Established in 1902, with a handful of dedicated physicians, the VCMS has grown to more than 300 physicians and their families living and working in Volusia County.
The strength of this Society is grounded in its members and committees, who work for the general welfare of the practicing physician, the public, and the medical community as a whole.
