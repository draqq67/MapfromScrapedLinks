Season 10 - Celebration
Our tenth season, CELEBRATION, remains true to intersection’s core values of curiosity, play and collaboration all in support of creativity and new music.   We can hardly believe it’s our 10th year of programming in this great music city!  As we celebrate the many amazing artists and partners we’ve had the honor of working with, we aim to have both playful, light musical experiences, and hold space for deep reflection and exploration.
In addition to our 10th season programming, check out our LISTEN project to hear some of our solo commissions.
  Our ears remain wide open!
