Changing The Way You Think About Painting ...One Brushstroke At A Time
We hold integrity as our ideal and simply put, we are committed to doing what we have said we will do. No compromises, no mistakes. We take pride in our reputation as a Company with a strong focus on customer service, a commitment to meeting delivery time line expectations and competitive pricing.
Our painters follow a rigorous process that includes priming, filling, sanding and Caulking before the first coat of paint is even applied to your custom work.
You may find other contractors who would argue such an approach is excessive, but we know it is the best way to ensure perfection.
Painting Concepts makes it easy for you to work with us. We strive to be as flexible as possible, working closely with you to:
Establish the specifications for the project by issuing a completed estimate in advance.
Inspect the project before, during and after to insure complete satisfaction.
Use Top Quality materials provided by the most respected names in the industry. These being Sherwin Williams, Porter Paints/PPG and Benjamin Moore.
Provide a preview of what your property will look like through a color rendition of the project
Adjusting the schedule to accommodate the multitude of factors that influence the repainting of your building.
