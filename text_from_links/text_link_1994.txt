JOIN OUR CHOIR
Are you looking to join a choir? Read on!
We’re one of London’s largest choirs, a community which performs on stages such as Cadogan Hall & Royal Festival Hall, with professional soloists and orchestras. We sing a variety of classical choral music, from early to modern, and everything in between!
The best part is there’s no audition to join us; we’re open to anyone passionate about music who wants to learn from our professionals. We have a lot to offer, so bring us your voice on a Monday evening to rehearse between 18:45 & 20:45 and we promise to kick off your week with a singing high!
