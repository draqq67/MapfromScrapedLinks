Testimonials
Installing new fuseboard and updating another
“From first contact to make the appointment to completion of job LKT could not be faulted. Staff polite, helpful, excellent workmanship and electrician cleared up leaving everything spotless. People so quick to complain but less so to praise SO "well done to the whole team"
