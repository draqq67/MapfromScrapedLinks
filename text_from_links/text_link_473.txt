                        According to Forrester Research, "Integration of multiple ESBs is straightforward, although
                        true federation is still missing."

                        That was true, until now. PointofData's team of data management and storage experts
                        has developed the Active Information PlatformTM, a solution that provides true data federation.


The Active Information Platform (AIP) is the world’s first scalable,
distributed data federation for structured and unstructured data.

                        With this single product, available today, you can solve difficult business problems that best of
                        breed packages from multiple vendors still fail to address.
