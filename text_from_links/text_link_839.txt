BUILDING ON THE SOLID ROCK OF JESUS CHRIST
Welcome!
**Please note our website is under re-construction. Please stop again for updates and additional information coming soon.” 
GET TO KNOW CORNERSTONE
Cornerstone Church was established in April 1990 and has been welcoming families for 34 years.
We began by meeting in a room at Central Wisconsin Airport before purchasing a church on 6th Street, then moving to our current location at 601 5th Street in Mosinee.
Join us for Sunday Morning Service at 10am
You are invited to join us before Sunday morning service for coffee in the Fellowship Hall as well.
ACCESSIBLE TO ALL
Although the Cornerstone Church building was built in 1899, we’ve made many updates to make it wheelchair friendly, with a ramp at the entrance and an elevator to all three floors.
If you have any questions about our accessible spaces, please reach out!
