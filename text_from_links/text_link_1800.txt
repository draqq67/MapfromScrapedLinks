Our Heritage
We’re a family run business and started from humble beginnings. Established in 1973, our growth has led us to become one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of duvets and pillows. Our products are lovingly made at our factory in Manchester and it’s estimated that 1 in 3 people in the UK sleep on a pillow we have made.
