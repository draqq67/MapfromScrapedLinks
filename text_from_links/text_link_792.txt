FLO JAPANESE RESTAURANT IN BELLEVUE
FLO Japanese Restaurant, a family-owned gem, started its journey as Downtown Bellevue’s premier Japanese restaurant in 2003. The evolving menu reflects the blending of traditional Japanese cuisine and our interpretation of the PNW palate, and an impressive sake and wine list. We offer the freshest & most carefully sourced and prepared sushi and Japanese food you’ll find in Bellevue.
The decor, the friendly faces, the captivating aromas of foods both unique and familiar, this is a place where a meal becomes an event. Impress your partner for a fancy night out, introduce your family to Japanese food in style, or arrange for a private event to make your special occasion truly special.
