GROSS FUCHS GROUP OF NETWORKS - GLOBAL NETWORKING MADE IN GERMANY
NETWORKING MADE IN GERMANY
We are your freight networking specialists! Under the umbrella of the Gross Fuchs Group you will find 5 well established freight forwarding networks bringing together mid-sized freight forwarding companies to cooperate with another on mutual benefit. 
Each of our members has passed an extensive selection process, ensuring that we only select the most reliable agents for our networks.
OUR VISION: TO GATHER INDEPENDENT MID-SIZED CARGO AGENTS AND FORWARDERS ACROSS THE WORLD
The Gross Fuchs Group was established in 2005 by Helmut Gross and Viktor Fuchs. Both of them are highly experienced in the freight forwarding industry and share many contacts across the globe to increase the productivity of their freight forwarding networks.
The Gross Fuchs Group was born with a vision to gather independent freight forwarding agents and bring them together under one roof. From the very beginning the networks of the Gross-Fuchs Group mushroomed very quickly making us one of the largest associations worldwide today.
