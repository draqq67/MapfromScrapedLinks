BIO
  COMMITTED TO CREATE AND TEACH THE ART AND CRAFT OF PHOTOGRAPHY
When I began teaching the One-on-One Zoom Streaming classes, they were way outside the ordinary approach of group in person classes and intended to reach a world wide underserved population. Covid and social distancing have have changed everything and distance learning is proven to be a successful way to learn this wonderful art form.
PHOTOARTS MARIN has been folded into PHOTOARTS CALIFORNIA (link below).
