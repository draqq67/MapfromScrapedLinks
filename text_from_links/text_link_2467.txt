Welcome
to Essex Community Foundation
We provide grants to charities and voluntary organisations in Essex.
We do this by working with individuals, families, businesses and charitable trusts, helping them to find and fund local groups that are tackling the issues they care about most.
Last year, we gave out £4.4 million.
