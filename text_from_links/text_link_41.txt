‚ÄúI am in my second week of Superfit Meal Prep. Absolutely love your food! The chorizo breakfast bowl is my favorite breakfast. But each one of your meals is filled with so much flavor and the meat is never dry. I have tried every single one under your paleo menu. My doctor told me I need to eat paleo due to my PCOS and I didn't really know where to start. Thanks to you I am 8lbs down, full of energy, and love what I am eating. I have told all of my friends and they are starting to sign up too!‚Äù

‚ÄúI am so happy I decided to try Superfit Foods. I am working full time and in school full time and it's so nice to easily pick up my meals and be able to have them readily available. There are a lot of great meals to choose from. Everything I have tried so far has been delicious. Best thing I have done for myself in a long time! I'm eating healthier and it tastes so good. Plus it takes away the extra stress of planning and prepping my own meals. Definitely recommend.‚Äù
