Revenue Transformation Levers
In order to achieve sustainable changes in mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets - and ultimately to drive Revenue Transformation - we focus on impacting the Three Qs: IQ, EQ, and XQ.
IQ
IQ refers to your intellect and knowledge; this is your innate intelligence, and your ability to grasp, learn, and develop concepts.
EQ
EQ refers to your mindset and emotional capability; this is your ability to manage the human side of sales with key skills like empathy.
XQ
XQ refers to processes and execution; this is your ability to embrace operational rigour, discipline in processes, and tactical execution.
Revenue Consultancy
As specialists in Revenue Transformation, we have a wealth of experience in identifying the critical bottlenecks that prevent your organisation from experiencing tangible revenue growth.

What Do Our Clients Think Of Us?
Director of Enablement, Immersive Labs
I am amazed at how much was accomplished in 3 months. Mentor Group listened intently to what was working and what wasn’t and brought the team so many innovative ideas to uplevel the Sales, Renewal, and CS processes. The training style is very effective, keeping things moving at a steady pace, sharing stories, and really listening when people ask questions to get at the heart of what they are asking.
