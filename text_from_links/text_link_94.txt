CUSTOMERSUS
A real hardware store! They aren't selling a bunch of other crap like so many other hardware stores. They have Ace hardware stuff including the largest assortment of the bolts and fasteners and hardware I've ever seen. I didn't really have much time to look around but I will be back and revise my review.

THE WHY, HOW, WHO
Our why is simple: bring a little more joy to the world of hardware and MRO supplies. We know our manufacturing, construction, and logistics customers have tough jobs, and we are dedicated to making their professional lives a little bit easier, and a little more fun.
Our how is more complex. We blend a diverse mix of ideas, design, technology, problem-solving, and people development. Much like a sports team, we value gritty continuous improvement as the cornerstone habit of success. And we don't do this work in isolation, we do this work in collaboration with you, our customers.
And finally our who... Our team is composed of car geeks, motorcycle mavens, musicians, Bears/Sox/Cubs/Hawks fans (and their rivals), hobbyists, dreamers, young and old alike. Family people, Single people. Shiny happy people holding hands and laughing.
