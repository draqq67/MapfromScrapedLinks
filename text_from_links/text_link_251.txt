Good Vision
Runs in our Family
At Dr. Black’s Eye Associates, we’re proud to say that we have provided expert eye care to a generation of patients in the Kentuckiana area using the most advanced technology available. When Dr. Brad Black established the practice over 30 years ago, he understood that showing respect and compassion is as important to patients as providing quality care and he made a commitment to treat each patient as he would a member of his own family.
Today, the family tradition of quality and personal attention continues to be the cornerstone of our practice. As one of the only locally and family owned and operated vision care practices in the region, we’re committed to treating all patients like family whether they're getting an annual exam or undergoing laser eye surgery. From infancy through the golden years, you can trust your vision to our team of highly trained specialists as we provide total eye care to your entire family.
