Her face may be unfamiliar, but there’s a good chance you’ve already heard Stephanie Forryan’s voice and music – on world tour with Chris Norman, in successful US television shows like “Lie to Me”, as the voice of apps or on releases alongside artists like Amy Winehouse and Duffy. 
The native New England songwriter thinks of herself as a song-hunter. She “found” her first song inside an old acoustic guitar and started stalking simple folk songs. On her quest for inspiration she decided follow music from Boston, Massachusetts to Berlin, Germany. Since then she has toured in over 25 countries on four continents, performing, writing, and recording with some of the world's most talented artists. 
Since returning to her solo career in 2015, Stephanie has released two albums: Dreamer (2015) and Sweet Insomnia (2016), which led to extensive touring and appearances that included Club Passim's campfire.festival (USA), Ringsted Festival (Denmark), and Bardentreffen (Germany). 
Stephanie is especially thankful for the regular support she receives on the crowdfunding site Patreon. To learn how you can support her music, visit her Patreon page.
