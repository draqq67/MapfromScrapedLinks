We provide a safe space for children and families at risk.
Some children don’t have loving homes that they can call their own. For whatever reason, the parents of these children are not able to provide for them and neither is their extended family. When this occurs, the child will be placed into the foster care system.
Dana's House is a foster home committed to the idea that children are entitled to an environment that is safe, healing, and encourages growth. For over twenty years we've been changing lives by offering emergency shelter, foster care, day care, and mental healthcare for children and families in need. 
You can change lives too!
