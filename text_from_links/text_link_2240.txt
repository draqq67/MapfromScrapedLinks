How We're Different ...
You may think we’re all the same, us salary sacrifice providers, but it’s not all about the cheapest cost for the car. We were set up to design electric car salary sacrifice schemes from the ground up from an HR perspective as a benefit. Our scheme is the lowest admin, slickest scheme on the market. Since 2011, when we implemented the UK’s first EV salary sacrifice scheme, we’ve been pioneering a unique approach to making our schemes accessible to all employers. Here’s some other areas we’re different to our competition:
No Admin
We write contract variations, recharges go direct to the employee, HMRC clearance, driverline team on hand for employees and engagement team for employers.
Leaver Protection
Simple, no quibbles, kicks in from day one.
Online Quote Engine
So employees can find their dream car, custom to their needs.
Free Workplace Charge Point
For businesses where 5 or more employees take on electric cars through salary sacrifice.
THE BENEFITS OF EV SALARY SACRIFICE SCHEME
Benefits For The Employee
  The idea behind salary sacrifice is a simple one; you give up part of your salary and, in return, your employer gives you a non-cash benefit, such as a car.
Once you accept a salary sacrifice car, your overall pay is lower, so you pay less tax and national insurance.
– Reduced national insurance contributions (NIC)
– Reduced income tax
– A brand new green car
Benefits For The Employer
The main advantage to employers for implementing salary sacrifice schemes are the savings they make in National Insurance Contributions (NICs).
As an employer, you pay NIC contributions on employees’ salaries, but benefits such as car salary sacrifice schemes or pension contributions are exempt.
Benefits For The Environment
We all know that green cars are better for the environment but how much greener are they really?
As the owner of an electric vehicle, you will be less dependent on fossil fuels.
Your transportation will also be emitting 30% less CO2.
Recharging an electric car will not add a significant amount to your energy bills. In fact, you will be spending around the same amount you would if you had 4 plasma TVs in your home, running 24/7.
