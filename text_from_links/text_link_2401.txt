Had a great private tour with my boyfriend. David was our guide and we had a lovely tour with him guiding us through different parts of the city, even a personalized part that we asked for, through Leith. Really great. We enjoyed it very much and feel more confident now to do a cycle in Edinburgh next time we visit. Thanks David!!

Finn patiently led our tour of 4 Canadians and 2 Americans through the city centre/holyrood/portobello tour on a beautiful afternoon.  We all had a good time!

David was a wonderful guide for our City Centre / Holyrood / Portobello tour. He was friendly, informative, chill - and was awesome with tips for my upcoming journey up to Glencoe and Skye.Happy I selected this tour as Iâ€™d already seen a good chunk of the central Edinburgh sites - we rode near several of those, but it was good to get out and about into areas that felt more like spots locals go.  Iâ€™m mostly thinking about Portobello beaches on our sunny day - or maybe those were all tourists?!? ðŸ¤£David, thx much!

This is the best way to see Edinburgh and the surrounding area. The tour guides are knowledgeable and professional and great cyclists. The Coast & Bridges Guided Cycle Tour skipped the normal tourist stops and I saw the real beauty of the Firth of Forth and itâ€™s coast.

We had a fabulous almost 20 mile bike ride with our guide Donald and shadowing guide David! Donald was full of historical knowledge and David was super friendly and easy to talk with! I highly recommend this company for your next bike tour in Edinburgh!!!
