RAPID RIVER LOGGING CAMP
"All You Can Eat, Served Family Style!"
Come Start A Tradition with Us!
The Rapid River Logging Camp was established in 1955, making it historic in itself. When you come fora a visit you will step back in time. As a logger you can eat fro metal plates and drink from tin cups, sample “logger raisins”, and eat as many pancakes as your stomach can hold! After you have finished, we’ll put you to work; walk the trails, feed the fish, chickens and ducks, gaze at antiques and rummage through the Foreman’s Shack (gift shop) for the perfect trinket or souvenir!
