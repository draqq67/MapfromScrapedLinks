ABOUT US
Seed Source was founded in Wayne, NE by Lowell Schardt and has been serving farmers since 2000. It started as a one man show, with Lowell spreading seed products to farm customers in Northeast Nebraska. Lowell had a vision to build a company that offered a different approach in the industry, focusing on customer relationships and driving on-farm yields. Seed Source has since expanded to a company network composed of ~20 employees and salespeople located in Northwest Iowa, southern South Dakota, as well as Northeast Nebraska.
Our mission is to provide products and services to assist our farm customers to attain the highest profits possible. We concentrate on seed products commonly grown in our area, with supporting products and services proven to add value to those products. We believe that if we contribute to our customers profitability, it will sustain our business well into the future. Our primary goal is customer profitability. We differentiate ourselves from our competition because we understand that you are not just a farmer and you need a partner that is more than just seed!
