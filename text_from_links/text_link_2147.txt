Welcome to Lovely Jubbly Fabrics
Are you placing a pre-order?

Pre-orders must be placed separately to stock items, and separate to other pre-orders for other collections/items.
If you place an order for stock items at the same time, your order will be held until the pre-order items arrive and are ready to ship.

Thank you so much for your continued support of my small business.
