HAPPY CUSTOMERS
After reading the water quality report for Brunswick County, we were determined to have a Whole House Water Filter System installed. Barry Williams Plumbing was honest, knowledgeable, prompt, professional and above all helpful in working with us. Betsy’s friendly customer service and Barry’s craftsmanship were superior. We highly recommend Barry Williams Plumbing LLC for all your plumbing needs!

Barry Williams Plumbing is first class. Barry installed tankless water heaters and a Flo by Moen that caught a leak that would have done major water damage to our beach home. Very professional and responsive. Highly recommend.

A Gentleman; Honest and Fair!
I cannot recommend Bary enough. He responded to our failed hot water heater almost immediately, advised us of our options, didn’t try to upsale, and completed the replacement quickly. He will be my one and only number to call for plumbing needs.
Thank you, Barry!
