Where We Are...
Our three self-catering holiday cottages are situated in the beautiful village of Broadway in the Cotswolds. They are well located for touring around the local Cotswold towns and villages, with Cheltenham and Stratford each just 25 minutes drive. If you prefer a peaceful get away from it all break, then these cottages all have beautiful gardens to enjoy and are close enough to the centre of Broadway village to walk in and sample the great selection of museums an array of independent shops and its own Steam Railway station. For those keen walkers Broadway has a wonderful selection of walking routes and is also situated on The Cotswold Way national trail.
Dog Friendly Cotswolds

Cotswold Cottage Holiday Reviews
Leanne G
Great time away at the cottage. Only a very short walk to Broadway High Street. The cottage itself is fully equipped with everything you would need, tasteful decor & clean rooms. Was welcomed with a lemon cake on arrival which was incredible! The perfect Cotswold stay.

Lovely cottage and setting. Feels like home from home and Andrew could not do enough to make us settled and welcome. Hope to be back in the near future as was the nicest cottage we have stayed at for some time.
