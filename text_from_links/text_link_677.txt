Historic LDS Tours…What do we do?

Our approach to historic places is private custom tours. It is that simple! You tell us what you want to see and how long you have and we do the rest. After traveling to these sacred locations time and again, Historic LDS Tours has created a unique experience for those looking to visit historic LDS sites. These tours are individually guided with small groups of people. Contact us today to plan your trip, the way you would like. You can see some suggested daily schedules under each tour, however, these can be adjusted to fit your desires. We do not have any pre-set dates, we can arrange to take you at your convenience. For more details on how we work, see Our Approach Page
