We Love Jesus
You’ll notice people at Crossroads talk about Jesus a lot. It’s not just a clever catch-phrase, He’s the singular passion of our church, our lives and the good news we seek to share with our city.
We Love Our City
We exist to spread a passion for Jesus Christ for the joy of all people within the city and extending to all nations.
We Want The Two To Meet
We want to see people meet Jesus, join others who love Jesus, grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus, and get involved in Jesus’ mission for God’s glory and the good of our city and world.
