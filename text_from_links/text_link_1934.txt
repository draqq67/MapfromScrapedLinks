Your health and safety remains our number one priority:
 Our practitioners are still mindful of Covid 19 and the implications involved in spreading the disease.
Therefore they will continue to use masks gloves etc. At Marlborough House we will no longer be enforcing the previous restrictions but will be recommending they are still followed.
We are still taking temperature readings of all clients on arrival at the clinic and are following a stringent cleaning regime between each appointment as well as deep cleaning daily.
Please do not attend your appointment if you have Covid 19 Symptoms or indeed a cough, cold, high temperature etc.
Please contact us to rearrange your appointment. Cancellation charges will not be levied for cancelling due to this reason.
