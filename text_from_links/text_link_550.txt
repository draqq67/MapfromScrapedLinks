About
      Our Retirement sale is over and the store is officially closed.
Uptown Lexington has been a wonderful place to build a business. We loved serving our local customers & making sure they had beautiful gifts, accessories & jewelry. It's been an AMAZING 30 years here on Main Street. We want to thank our loyal customers that we now know as friends. Thank you for your support and thank you for all the memories!
