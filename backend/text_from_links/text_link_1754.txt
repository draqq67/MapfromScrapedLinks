WHY CHOOSE US
Addressing the root cause of your injury.
We aim to get you better faster by addressing the root of the problem, not just the area that hurts. We aim to help you achieve a long term solution to your injuries. Realising that consistency in training is the key to performance, we will never tell you “just to rest”, unless we have to. We can advise you on cross training you can do to keep fit whilst injured.  Our varied skill set and hands-on approach means we have a lot of success with the chronic complex injuries that may be holding you back, not just in your sport, but in life in general. We love to see our patients reach their goals and get back to what they love doing, no matter what that is.
MEET THE TEAM
Constantly challenging ourselves to be the best
We are dedicated to continually training, challenging and developing ourselves to ensure we are at the leading edge of our profession. The best practices are constantly evolving and Alison leads the internal training at the clinic, working with the team, in small groups and individually ensuring that all staff provide the same high standards of care. All members of CSPC staff also attend regular external training. Many of these courses are run at the clinic with external educators to further expand our knowledge and experience.

PATIENT TESTIMONIALS

Over the years I have worked with a number of the physios at CSPC, I have found them to be up to date with their thinking and treatments, willing to share their knowledge with one and other and clients. I always recommend CSPC to friends and clients. They have helped hold body and soul together, thank you.
