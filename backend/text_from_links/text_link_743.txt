The EtherMeter is our patented flagship — a flow meter gateway for SCADA, telemetry, and building automation systems. It leverages encoder technology prevalent in the water meter industry to provide the automation system with error-free, revenue-grade totalization and rate-of-flow data from its existing flow meters.
The EtherMeter effectively transforms flow meters into Modbus and/or Allen-Bradley devices on your automation network. Supported encoder-type meters include those by Sensus, Neptune, Master Meter, Metron-Farnier, Mueller/Hersey, Honeywell/Elster, Badger, RG3, Kamstrup, Zenner, ABB, Actaris, Invensys, Itron, Kent, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Siemens, Sitrans, and many others. The EtherMeter also features excellent pulse-handling capabilities for non-encoder-type meters.
TheMeterDisplay is a patented, economical, remote wall display for encoder-type water meters. Its features include a large, backlit display, a pass-through port for an AMI/AMR endpoint, unparalleled meter compatibility, an outdoor-rated housing, and a user-replaceable battery. In short, it's not 'a' meter display... It's ’the’ meter display!
The Signalizer is a patented, economical, panel-mount instrument that converts encoder-type water meter signals into a 4-20mA flow-proportional signal and a Pulse volume-proportional signal.  It also features a pass-through encoder port, so that concurrent connectivity to an AMI/AMR endpoint is always available.
The Analog/Pulse Kit is a family of economical, panel-mount and wall-mount instruments that converts pulse meter signals into a 4-20mA flow-proportional signal, a Pulse volume-proportional signal, and a Flow-Switch.
The Universal Duplexer is a patented signal splitter for encoder-type water meters.
The Encodalizer is an economical, meter-mount instrument that adds an AMR/AMI encoder signal to many Modbus-enabled flow meters. Examples include the Siemens FM Mag 6000 and the Flowtronic Torpee Insertion MagMeter.
The Smart Bell-202 Modem is our drop-in replacement for the recently-discontinued Schneider Electric (Control Microsystems) Model 5902 Modem. Optimized for Radio-Telemetry applications, our Model SB.202 is the easiest-to-use Bell-202 modem in the industry.
