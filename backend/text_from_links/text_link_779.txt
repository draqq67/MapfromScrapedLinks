Our Work
We turn Great Ideas Into World-class Solutions


Helping The City of Houston
Build Forward
Idea
The City of Houston came to AtLink with an idea for a web application that provides an interactive map so Houstonians could see "What's going in my neighborhood" as well as how funds are being used to improve and maintain the city.
Solution
AtLink developed BuildHoustonForward.org, a simple-to-use web application that provides interactive information regarding the City of Houston's programs to enhance, improve, and maintain streets and drainage systems without accruing additional debt.
