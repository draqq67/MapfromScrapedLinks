CONFIDENCE AT ANY AGE
20s
Women and men in their 20s should focus on good medical-grade skin care, and less sun exposure. Facials also have great benefits such as preventive care, hydration, exfoliation, brightening, and nourishment. 
30s
In your 30s, fillers can smooth away fine lines that start to creep in and Botox® can help prevent the formation of lines in the brows or forehead area before they get too deep.
40s
Many women in this age group consider dermal fillers such as Juvederm® to restore lost facial volume. Thermismooth targets the areas that you specifically want to improve to look younger and more refreshed.
50s
In your 50s, facial volume rapidly decreases which can be treated by Sculptra®. Sciton’s Forever Young BBL™ laser provides patients with clearer, smoother, and more youthful-looking skin. 
  60s+
In your 60s, skin elasticity is at a minimum and static wrinkles are all over the face. This is a good time to consult the experts at Pure 111 to help with a more rejuvenated, youthful look.
