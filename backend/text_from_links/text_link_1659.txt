About Martyn
Martyn started M. C. Video in 1996 after working part time in various production companies. He quickly became associated with producing wedding videos of a very high standard and was in great demand by brides across the UK. Along side this part of the business Martyn was transferring cine film to VHS tape and the duplication of videos for the growing corporate market. In the late 1990's he joined the IOV and quickly qualified as a Master Member of the Institute of Videographers.
His camera and editing skills were not going unnoticed and he started to freelance for a number of production houses. This work sent Martyn all over the world, filming in the Himalayas, Northern India, Las Vegas, California, Canada, Kenya, Georgia, Oman and almost every country in Europe.
The filming of Motor sports started in the late 2000's, filming Motocross, Extreme Sports and Red Bull events and then transitioned to film for TDi Media helping to create programmes for Motors TV (Europe) and Sky Sports.
Since 2015 Martyn has freelanced for Crown Media, a media simulation company that supplies TV media training to the armed forces, usually the British MOD, The European Army and NATO.
Although kept busy filming the converting and transferring of video or cine film is always going to be the core of the business. Keeping memories alive for future generations.
