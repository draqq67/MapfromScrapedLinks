Second time using this excellent company. Easy to book a service visit online and confirm details via text. Engineer arrived ahead of schedule. Quick discussion and investigation and the problem was identified and resolved within minutes. Additional checks performed to make sure the appliance was working as it should. Engineer advised how to avoid similar issues in future. Whole process was quick, efficient and friendly.
