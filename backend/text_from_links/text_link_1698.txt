The Chile Travel Specialists are a specialist tour operator who have been creating luxury travel itineraries to Chile for over a decade. This web site is a comprehensive resource of Chile travel and honeymoon information, featuring practical, impartial advice on cities, hotels, activities and much more.
On your behalf, we’ve travelled extensively within the regions ourselves, enabling us to offer first hand experience and local knowledge. Your holiday to Chile with us will therefore be much more than ‘packaged’, it will be everything you want to experience of this wonderful destination.
At approximately 2 million square kilometres the country of Chile is actually one of the smallest of the countries of South America but, due to it being ten times as long as it is wide, it covers a hugely diverse range of climates and conditions. It is this range that has allowed it to become one of South America's strongest economies, with a very rich mining industry, as well as one of Latin America's top destinations for those looking to explore.
As a brief overview, we have put together a little list of the most popular sights and sounds:
Santiago
This vibrant and burgeoning city is right at the heart of the new Chile. A great place for a couple of nights of partying and fine dining. Read more...
Valparaiso
Located on the coast to the west of Santiago, Valparaiso is a fun and quirky city, great for at least 2 nights. Read more...
The Wine Valleys
The infamous vineyards of Chile are a paradise for those in search of a change of pace in beautiful surrounds. Read more...
The Atacama Desert
Right up in the north of the country, the (second) driest place on earth awaits. A haven for the active, the range of properties and activities abound. Read more...
The Lake District
A verdant and visually stunning region of lakes and volcanoes, Chile’s lake district is, again, an active destination with superb walking in particular. Read more...
The Torres del Paine and Patagonia
Arguably South America’s most famous park, the Torres del Paine never fails to impress and, with some truly excellent properties to choose from, it is recommended to spend at least 3 nights in the region. Read more...
Easter Island
The mysterious Polynesian Islands of the central Pacific are about as remote a place as is possible to get to on the planet. A few days wandering through the towering “moai” statues and exploring the extinct volcanoes is something that only a handful will ever do.
