Welcome to the website of The Ultimate Rotator, the next step in gobo rotators. This unit will soon prove to be a valuable addition to your lighting equipment stock.
With two drive motors, The Ultimate Rotator's flexibility will allow for multiple new Special Effects not possible with the
compteitors' models. By allowing you to
drive your lighting ideas in new directions, your options will be limited only by your imagination.
Since one controller can operate more then one unit, by combining two or three units, you can turn your ETC Source Four Ellipsoidals into semi-intelligent lights.
