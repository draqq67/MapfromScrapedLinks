Helen Lee Graphic Designer
Based in Staffordshire in the UK I began work as a freelance designer in 1998. Since then I have worked independently for small businesses and individuals as well as alongside other internet developers and design agencies. Being an internet based business has enabled me to work for companies all over the globe with the same high quality service and results. With a degree in graphic design I now specialise in logo design and web development. I design both commercially and for personal enjoyment so you can be sure of 100% commitment to your project. If you are looking for a new brand image or to develop your current one please contact me for a rapid response and a competitive price.
