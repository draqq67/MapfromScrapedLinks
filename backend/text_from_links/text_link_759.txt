The trophy has been updated to include Bill’s NBA Hall of Fame ring, and his 1977 TrailBlazer’s championship ring.

Each year the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame helps preserve Oregon’s rich sports heritage through its recognition of outstanding Oregon athletes and special contributors to sport.
In addition, Oregon Sports Hall of Fame college scholarships will be awarded to Oregon scholar-athletes, made possible by contributions from the MacTarnahan Family Trust. Six student-athletes will be awarded $3000 scholarships to be used for continuing their education at Oregon colleges and universities. They are Jordan Clements, Yamhill Carlton HS, Carter Affolter, Tillamook HS, Eli Watnick-Wizeman, McDaniel HS, Denali Bosco, North Marion HS, Tamerra Cervantes Carlos, Springfield HS, and Aaliyah Gaboriault, Harrisburg HS.
The event will be held this year at the Doubletree by Hilton, Lloyd Center, with a cocktail reception starting at 5:30 PM, followed by dinner and program at 7 PM. Guests may take advantage of free parking, across the driveway from the banquet entrance. As noted, Dwight Jaynes will emcee the ceremony. Tickets are $125 per person; tables of 10 are $1200.
