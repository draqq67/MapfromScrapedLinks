HELLO & WELCOME TO SNARESBROOK PREP!
Our SchoolCurriculumAdmissions
Welcome from the Head
We are a small independent school for children aged three-and-a-half to eleven where every child is seen, known and heard.
We have three aims: to ensure each child reaches their full academic potential; to ensure they can do the right thing, at the right time, in the right way and for the right reasons; and, to ensure they leave us full of confidence and inspired to seek and seize all the opportunities secondary education has to offer.
For over 80 years we have built a reputation for academic excellence and for personal pastoral care in the image of the school’s early Head, Mrs Mathison, who asked simply, ‘if this was my child what would I want for them?’
These aims were born out in our last inspection report with the inspection team acknowledging that ‘Pupils feel extremely well-prepared for the next stages in their education’ and with our pastoral care graded as excellent.
Generally after 8 years our pupils move on to Bancroft’s, Brentwood, Chigwell, City of London, Forest, and St. Edmunds College where they continue their personal journey of growth and self-actualization.
If you would like to get a feel for the school, please contact the school office to arrange an informal visit when I’d be delighted to show you around.
We look forward to showing you around.
