What people say about us
Very quick to respond and to resolve the issues. Especially Cheryl and James are very friendly and professional at the same time. Also, if you're a tenant, there is no agency fees! What else would you ask for? I would recommend
What I like about them is the simplicity of their service, with no hidden costs, unlike with the majority of agencies I've been dealing with who will charge astronomical fees. Also, they are good for the tenants who don't have to pay any commission, like they would with other agencies.
