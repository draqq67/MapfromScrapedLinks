Grey Hackle Lodge, in scenic Christopher Creek, is comprised of 10 cabins on 1.5 acres of nature’s splendor, and backs to the Tonto National Forest. Amongst the tranquil trees you even have your own hiking trail, and are within walking distance to Christopher Creek, the Creekside Steakhouse & Tavern, and nearby seasonal horseback riding.
Fishing, hiking, mountain biking, bird watching, wildlife watching, photography and cross-country skiing are just outside your cabin!  The cabins are close to creeks, streams and lakes, which anglers will appreciate. Hikers and mountain bikers will delight in the variety of terrain available to test their mettle. Relax — enjoy our crisp mountain air.
Cool summer temperatures, magnificent fall foliage, pristine mountain snows or the renewal of spring await you. Cook in or Cook out! We are within walking distance to area restaurants, taverns, Christopher Creek and back to the Tonto National Forest. Spend evenings star gazing as you roast marshmallows in our courtyard around the fire pit or enjoy the sounds of silence while sitting on your porch.
Our cabin rentals offer you a quick escape to the forested high country of Rim Country in Central Arizona. Christopher Creek, nestled under the Mogollon Rim, inspires you to enjoy nature at its best. Our delightful cozy accommodations, nestled amid majestic ponderosa pines in the heart of the Tonto National Forest recreation area provide you with the opportunity to enjoy it all from your doorstep.
Refresh and renew your soul! Why not make your reservation today? We’re just a scenic 1 hour 30 minute drive from Arizona’s major cities and airports.
