Time to come back! Or maybe try Shiatsu or acupuncture for the first time?
Find information on these pages to help you manage your health, or if you live in the UK near the Towcester - Daventry -  Banbury - Northampton - Milton Keynes area come to our individual or group sessions.
Acupuncture and Shiatsu facilitate the healing process by setting the conditions right for the body to do what it wants to do on its own. They achieve this by promoting circulation, relieving nearby muscle tension and interrupting nerve pain signals.
For individual treatments you choose whether you would like Acupuncture, Shiatsu, or a combination of both. Wendy will also recommend simple exercises for you to do in between sessions, and she will suggest changes in diet and lifestyle that you can try in order to improve your health and well-being.
Wendy Francis
Wendy Francis is a qualified Acupuncturist and Shiatsu practitioner, having completed a three year Shiatsu training course with the British School of Shiatsu-Do, Bedford Branch, plus a postgraduate year, followed by two years further training in Chinese Healthcare and Acupuncture at Acumedic in London, leading to a diploma awarded by the CMIR (Chinese Medical Institute and Register) and the University of Beijing.
For Wendy the attraction of Acupuncture and Shiatsu is twofold. It has enabled her to get in touch with her own healing energy, which has resulted in a great improvement in her own health, and it also means that she can help others make this discovery for themselves.

Beautiful autumn - "season of mists and mellow fruitfulness". In the Chinese calendar it is associated with the Metal element - a time to consider your lungs and large intestine - time to consolidate your energy and clear out waste in preparation for the new. Breathe! #acupuncture #shiatsu #goodhealth #autumn
