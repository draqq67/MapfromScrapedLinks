Just wanted to say a massive thank you to our Quicksilva contact for all of their guidance and help in the compliance process.
We couldn’t have done it without the support of the Qxlva team.
Strategic Manager, Online Pharmacy Services
The Quicksilva service team provided excellent support and information to help with our onboarding. Our contact went above and beyond to ensure a timely and detailed response to my queries, and the ongoing service has been fantastic.
