Our Garden Design, Planting and Delivery teams on a very special mission
A WARM WELCOME
Architectural Plants is a specialist horticultural nursery in Pulborough, West Sussex, set within 32 acres of open fields surrounded by farmland overlooking the South Downs.
Our team, led by Owner, Guy Watts are experts in plants that are both shapely and exotic – Japanese ‘Niwaki’ and European topiary, hardy palms, bananas, and other unusual tropical specimens. We are also enthusiastic advocates of screening plants, and our ever expanding range of rare and evergreen trees both large and small. Many of our plants are homegrown and we also source from elsewhere in the UK. If you have an inkling that the sculptural and rare are for you and have just stumbled across us, then you might also find yourself quite quickly prey to the same ridiculous addiction that we share with our long standing friends and customers.
