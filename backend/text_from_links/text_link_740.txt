is a creative services 
company
We take your pulse
We get to know your company. Your products, your people, your vision. We study them until they also become ours.
After we have done that, we get to know something else of yours.
Your competition.
Positioning is relative
The textbook definition of positioning is how a product exists in relationship to its competitors.
Only after we know what positions your competitors occupy can we fill the void with your meaningful difference.
Know your target
Finally, we get to know your target audience.
Your positioning only has validity if it resonates with your audience.
