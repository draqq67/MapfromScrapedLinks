PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE IN THE DIGITAL WORKPLACE
The impact of information technology on work efficiency is critical but rarely measured. It is expected to save us time and to function flawlessly, but the reality is often very different.
Omnicontext™ discovers and develops productive work patterns and habits for millions of users and hundreds of our enterprise customers. It quantifies the business contribution of digital technology.
Our state-of-the-art software collects and analyzes activity and operations data from an unmatched range of platforms and applications. With decades of research and engineering experience, we know what data to capture and how to interpret them.
Individual customers of Omnicontext™ use Personal Analytics to understand how they spend time, to know who are their important contacts, and to make themselves efficient in all they do.
With our products, the productivity insight and the underlying data are fully owned and controlled by the customers, for their own competitive advantage.
