Overview
Ratings & Reviews
With more than 30 years of land-sales experience and a real-life work history in farm, timber, and wildlife management, Mark leverages his deep knowledge of real estate and extensive network of contacts on behalf of his clients and the agents he mentors. 
As a licensed broker in Oklahoma, Mississippi, Arkansas, New Mexico, Colorado, and Alabama he is positioned to assist buyers and sellers with a wide range of services, from sealed-bid sales and auctions to traditional representation. 
After joining National Land Realty, Mark quickly saw the power of the national team to promote properties to unique and varied buyers across a wide range of platforms. By maximizing his expertise and NLR’s technology, he makes a positive difference for landowners while building a growing team of land professionals in several states. 
Both of Mark’s parents grew up on farms and some of his best childhood memories are tied to his grandparents’ cattle farm in the Ozark hills. He is a second-generation real estate professional, and his son Andrew is also an agent for NLR.
