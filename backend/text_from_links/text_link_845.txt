From a Personal Struggle to a Global Company.
Meet Colette, founder of Joylux. She embarked on this journey after experiencing the challenges of transitioning from motherhood to menopause in just a few years.
As an entrepreneur focused on anti-aging beauty devices, she had an illuminating idea – why not apply the rejuvenating benefits of red-light used on the face to intimate tissues? Colette joined forces with renowned Ob-Gyn, Dr. Sarah, and voila - vFit was born.
