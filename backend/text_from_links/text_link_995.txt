We are a family run organic winery situated in the heart of the Chianti Classico region between Florence and Siena, not far from the village of Castellina in Chianti. Nittardi enjoys a reputation for producing a variety of elegant and fine wines. Not a year goes by without that our wines receive an important award or rating. As a tribute to its most celebrated owner, Michelangelo Buonarroti, we also maintain a very special connection with Art, Culture and History.
With different apartments in its historic buildings surrounded by breathtaking scenery, Nittardi offers an ideal atmosphere for relaxed family holidays in the countryside or private and company parties and events.
