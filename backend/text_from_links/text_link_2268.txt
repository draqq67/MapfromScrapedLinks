HISTORY OF BURGON AND BALL
BURGON AND BALL TODAY
Burgon & Ball has continued to go from strength to strength and our tools and garden equipment are now endorsed by the Royal Horticultural Society, one of the highest accolades in the gardening industry.
BURGON & BALL’S BEGINNING
Burgon & Ball’s garden supplies heritage goes all the way back to 1730, when we first began manufacturing agricultural shears in Sheffield, known as the Steel City due to its skills in knives and steel.
GROWTH THROUGH THE CENTURIES
From our inaugural products we soon expanded our range of agricultural supplies and began manufacturing high quality garden tools and accessories. By 1897 we were exporting our products around the globe.
