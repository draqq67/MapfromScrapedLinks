  Hankinson Whittle Programmed Portfolio
From November 2022 all Companies within our Group will operated under the banner of Hankinson Whittle Programmed - a recognised and valued brand in the industry for over 48 years.
Hankinson Whittle Programmed is moving from strength to strength. Over the past 5 years Hankinson Whittle Programmed has  evolved beyond being just a painting contractor into a much more diverse operation with a full range of property maintenance services. We deliver a service of the highest quality and looks to enrich every building and structure it works on.
Hankinson Whittle Programmed has also evolved into a much more socially responsible business - a business with strong values. a business that cares about the people who work for it and in the communities it operates in. it wants to offer something back and enrich those people and communities.
Our name and the logo seeks to communicate our evolution. It reflects a new era for the Company and represents our core values, what we do and how we operate. its an identity that also hopefully communicates a sense of the Company and its reason for being.
