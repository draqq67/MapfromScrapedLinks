STYLISH COTTAGES WITH HOT TUBS

Welcome to Ivy Farm Cottages Carleton, Skipton, North Yorkshire

  Cosy and comfortable Cottages - with hot tubs 

Ivy Farm Cottages are conveniently located just 2 miles and within comfortable walking distance from Skipton - a historic market town famous for being the Gateway to the Yorkshire Dales.   The cottages have been created from what was the original barn and buildings to Ivy Cottage Farm which dates back to the late 16th Century. Sadly no longer functioning as a working farm, the cottages still exude the charm and character of their historic roots. 
Located in the charming village of Carleton-in-Craven on the outskirts of Skipton, you can enjoy breathtaking views across the valley;  peaceful sounds and sometimes even the fragrances of the countryside.
These unique and stylish holiday cottages, each one accommodating a maximum of just 2 people, come with the added luxury of their own private hot tub.  They are within close proximity to some of the most popular villages in the area such as Malham Cove, Bolton Abbey, Grassington, and Upper Wharfedale making them the perfect retreat to stay at when exploring this beautiful part of the Yorkshire Dales.

We offer short breaks, with a minimum stay of just two nights for those with limited time and give discounts for longer stays.  Some may love this and some may not;  we do not accept dogs/pets in the the cottage.
