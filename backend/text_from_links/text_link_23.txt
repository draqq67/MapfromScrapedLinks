Hi! I‚Äôm Katy.
I like to make things.  All the things.
It‚Äôs in my blood.  My father is an engineer with a knack for technology, photography and construction.  My mother is a baker, quilter, crafter and all-around creative genius.  It was impossible to do anything but become a mixture of those two.
I truly believe that happiness is handmade.  Nothing beats the overwhelming rush of pride and pure joy when you create something by hand.  It‚Äôs a high that is unlike anything else and that feeling I get while creating is the reason that I keep coming back for more.
Thanks for stopping by and being part of my creative journey!
