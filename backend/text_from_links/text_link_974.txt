  Field-friendly technology to enable measurement for better health outcomes
What We Do
Nutrition Programs
To ensure a nutrition program has impact, the target nutrients must reach those that need it most. This means measuring nutrients at every point of the food value chain. As a technical partner, we make this possible.
Food Quality & Safety
We help global food and ingredient producers, research institutes and food testing laboratories to lower nutrient testing costs using our innovative mobile labs.
Animal Nutrition
Optimum vitamin supply is a prerequisite in supporting the health and performance of animals. Our mobile labs enable the assessment of nutritional status within minutes in the field.
Human Diagnostics
BioAnalyt is creating advanced iCheck devices for point-of-care screening using multi-modal sensing tech to diagnose nutritional, metabolic, and inflammatory diseases. The primary application is screening for iron deficiency and anemia with just one blood drop.
