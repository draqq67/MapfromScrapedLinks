Best pain free Brazilian wax ever! Went today for Brazilian intimate waxing. The therapist was super- efficient, professional in her approach and she caused me very minimal discomfort. Would definitely recommend this salon.

Can’t praise Kirsty enough….absolutely amazing!!! Had an amazing back massage followed by a zen spa pedicure by the lovely Kirsty today! She was so pleasant, friendly and is absolutely brilliant at what she does! Can honestly say it was the best massage I’ve ever had! Thanks again Kirsty, will be back again for sure! x

Fabulous Salon Had a Decleor Vitamin Glow facial with Sarah-May. Absolutely fabulous from start to finish. So relaxing and I definitely felt pampered! The salon is spacious, beautifully laid out and staff so pleasant.
