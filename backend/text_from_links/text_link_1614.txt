Cookies for an optimized user experience
We use cookies and similar technologies ("technologies") on our services for automated data capture. Some of these technologies are necessary for operation and cannot be deactivated. Other non-strictly necessary technologies help us to measure the success of our marketing activities, to analyse the use of our online service and to make it even more customized for you. By clicking on "Advanced settings" you can decide which technologies you allow.

If you give your consent, you allow the Universal Music GmbH to use technologies that are not strictly necessary. This includes the transmission of data to third-party providers who may use it for their own purposes, e.g. profiling. You can revoke your consent at any time by changing the Privacy settings linked below on the left.

For further information, see "Security & Privacy".

Note on data processing in the USA: If you consent to the use of non-strictly necessary technologies, you also consent that your data may be processed in the USA. The USA does not have data protection laws at levels comparable to those under EU law. There is a risk that US authorities may access your data even without legal protection.
