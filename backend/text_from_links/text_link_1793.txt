Welcome to Woodland Adventurers

We've been delivering Outdoor Education to children and adults since 2011 and we would love to be able to support you on your own journey of discovery
We strive to connect people with nature and the great outdoors, for the benefits of overall health, well-being and happiness.

Being in the outdoors can heighten our sensory experiences. Whether it's seeing dappled sunlight through the leaves, feeling the warmth of the sun on your face, watching a deer graze before it realises your presence, or feeling the chill of the breeze sending shivers down your back, nature offers an abundance of experiences, enabling a heightened feeling of being alive and in the moment.

We believe that when we are in a happy place with our senses alert, it's the perfect environment to enable learning. Some of our courses are in person and some are online. Whichever path you choose we aim to support you in your enjoyment and breadth of experiences in making the most of the great outdoors in your own settings and beyond.
Woodland Adventurers is based in Box, Corsham, Wiltshire - between Bath and Chippenham
