About

The Wichita Academy of Pharmacists unites pharmacists from all practices of pharmacy in Wichita and the surrounding Kansas communities for the purpose of networking and providing support to continually develop the profession of pharmacy.

Founded in 1964, The Wichita Academy of Pharmacists is governed by an elected Board of Directors who serve the membership with:
- Informative dinner meetings (4 per year)
- Continuing education opportunities
- Legislative updates
- Community service projects
- Pharmacy student scholarships

As a respected professional organization, The Wichita Academy of Pharmacists provides a voice for its members with other groups including: legislators, the State Board of Pharmacy, the Kansas Pharmacists Association, and insurance payers (e.g., Medicaid).

Each member receives all of these benefits for $150 per year (or $75 for trainees), along with the dinner meetings and continuing education programs in Wichita, at no additional charge.
