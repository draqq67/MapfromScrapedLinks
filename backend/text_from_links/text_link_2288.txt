The Good Guest brings The Indoor Sleeping Bag
- For a Comfortable Stay Away from Home
Extra large in width and length.
Made from sustainable soft cotton and filled with pure new washable wool.
Lightweight but warm in winter and breathable in summer.
Washable in a domestic washing machine.
Two can be zipped together to make a very generous double.
No problem with storage - they make smart cushions and bedspreads.
The Good Guest is very excited to announce that we will be using a lightweight pure washable wool from British sheep to fill our Indoor Sleeping Bags from now on.
Pure wool is very sustainable and is a natural, breathable insulator, cool in summer and warm in winter.
We will be able to tell you from which flock of Cheviot sheep has produced the filling for your Indoor Sleeping Bag.
I am thrilled and proud to support British Sheep farmers.
This makes The Indoor Sleeping Bag even more practical and even more attractive to the conscientious guests amongst us.
We are also launching our own little pillows, filled with soft and bouncy washable wool. These little pillows make an excellent present.
