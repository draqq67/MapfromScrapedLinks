Clearer communication through colour
Problems We Solve
We believe that effective communication is the key to all relationships.
At work and beyond.
Our Approach
Clarity4D uses the language of colour to support continuous growth across four dimensions
1D) Discover how you see yourself
Identify strengths and development areas through self-awareness
2D) Discuss others’ perception of you
Understand how you come across to others
3D) Diversify your hidden potential
Broaden skills beyond your natural tendencies
4D) Develop your full potential over time
Commit to continuous personal development
Our Approach
Clearer communication means stronger relationships.
Stronger relationships lead to superior outcomes.
Going beyond providing personality profiles, our tools sit at the heart of development journeys for individuals, teams and organisations.
Problems We Solve
We believe personality profiling should be for everyone, and that colour creates a common language.
We are committed to making profiles relevant and available to everyone.

SAGE thinking
Our colour energies are simple to understand and there is no confusing psycho-jargon in our profiles. Personal development should be accessible for all.
We have created a range of tools, designed to meet individual, corporate and not- for-profit needs at an affordable price point.
The universal language of colour ensures our profiles have global application and we have built Clarity4D with that in mind.
Incorporating goal setting and action plans across the four dimensions into our Profiles ensures effective, ongoing development.
