The firm is an established and dynamic commercial law firm based in London. We take pride in developing long-term relationships especially with start - ups, young companies, businesses, professionals and entrepreneurs. But we are also now instructed by larger private companies for specialist litigation cases.
Our clients come from all areas of industry and the professions. We act for both domestic and international clients who value our knowledge, skills and experience together with our commercial approach and solution - driven service.
The firm was established in 2006 by John Walmsley. John is a solicitor with 30 years experience of working in respected City firms in London and Birmingham. John established the firm to provide high quality legal advice focusing on commercial dispute resolution with a particular focus on construction and insurance. The practice grew to focus more on general contractual litigation.More recently the firm has focused on insolvency, shareholders disputes and corporate related disputes involving civil fraud.
We are able to offer legal advice to our clients in a lean and efficient manner. We are open and transparent about costs at all stages of the working relationship.
We are highly responsive, client - focused and easy to work with.
