ADVENTURES IN LEARNING
Adventures in Learning is an after-school educational and enrichment program dedicated to improving the lives of Long Island children in need of after-school care and instruction. Housed in the Hagedorn Community Center at the Manhasset/Great Neck EOC, Adventures provides a warm and caring environment where children develop homework skills while benefiting from computer instruction, literary and math programs, and cultural activities.
