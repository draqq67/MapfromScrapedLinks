Why Customers Love Us
★★★★★
Easily one of my favorite Amazon purchases this year. Has literally doubled the life of our produce and paid for itself in less than a month. This is one of those things you wish you'd learned about years ago! A real money saver.

We are an older couple who don’t eat as much as we used to and so we found many fresh refrigerated vegetables and fruits would spoil in 5-8 days and we’d end up throwing out half of the product. But no more. With these appleS as we are finding these foods last at least 10 days longer than normal and we are able to eat all of the foods. We love it!.
