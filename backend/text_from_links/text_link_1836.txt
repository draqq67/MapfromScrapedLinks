Beauty @ Urban Escape
Huddersfield Beauty Salon
Situated on Station Street, we are a perfectly central Huddersfield Beauty Salon, and just down from the train station, Beauty @ Urban Escape offers the discerning client a full range of up to the minute beauty treatments and services.
We are in the centre of Huddersfield…
Although we are in HD1, just off Westgate, we are slightly away from the hustle and bustle of the centre but still easy to find and convenient for lunchtime appointments or after work treatments. All our treatments can be adapted to fit your busy schedule. Alternatively, if you have the time we can pamper!
Come see us at 8 Station Street in Huddersfield, head to our contact page to find us or give us a call on 01484 424244.
We look forward to pampering you!
