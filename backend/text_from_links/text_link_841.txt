TRANSMISSIONS
ARE OUR SPECIALTY
AUTOTOMATIC TRANSMISSION REPAIR
An automatic transmission has many different internal functioning components that must operate in sync with one another. The automatic transmission is connected to the engine with a torque converter. If your automatic transmission is slipping or hard shifts are noticed please plan to bring it in and leave with us to diagnose and hopefully keep a small problem from becoming an expensive one.
MANUAL TRANSMISSION REPAIR
Several possible causes for a manual transmission to be hard to shift are a faulty clutch, hydraulic leak, damaged synchronized gears and more. Bring your vehicle in and drop it off for a diagnosis as soon as possible to prevent more damage.
