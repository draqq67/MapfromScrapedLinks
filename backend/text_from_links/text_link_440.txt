Our Dealer Benefits
SafeBasementsTM Gold Standard Dealers
View Dealer Oath
“Many of our competitors are more marketing driven companies, offering very slick collateral material, and large teams of sales results based dealers. Our opinion is we'd rather have a small group of highly trained foundation experts, than a huge dealer network of both good and not so good members"
The SafeBasementsTM Waterproofing and Foundation Repair dealer network is a group of carefully selected contractors working to only offer the best products and services. SafeBasementsTM only accepts members that pass strict requirements and agree to fulfill ongoing educational training, while maintaining an excellent reputation in their service areas. Not just any repair contractor can become a member. We take the time to qualify each contractor to ensure proper and efficient installation for our repair products. SafeBasementsTM products are only available through the SafeBasementsTM Dealer Network.
