2023 La Baixada, Álvaro Palacios, Priorat
Dry | Red | Still
The extremely aromatic Baixada has got everything. Blackberry-pure fruit, blossom, crushed herbs and a saline element reflecting the warm mineral soils of its small 1.3 hectare plot within the Finca Dofi. An immensely satisfying finish which seems to go on and on.
