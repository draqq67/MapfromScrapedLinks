GAMEMAKER IS FOR EVERYONE
"I’m impressed with how well GameMaker scales when you start out - from knowing nothing to getting familiar with it. [...] I still like GameMaker today, as a full time developer, just because it has all the tools I need to make the games."
Greg Lobanov (Chicory: A Colorful Tale)
