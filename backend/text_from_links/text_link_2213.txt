scarves, art & design
We make art to wear as scarves, using the finest natural fabrics as our canvas. Each simple cloth square continues the creative process by inspiring personal style.

Alba Amicorum is a growing community of artists spanning different generations, cultural backgrounds, and media.

Along with our scarves, other works of art can be viewed and purchased at our London studio in Belgravia, by appointment, or here online.
