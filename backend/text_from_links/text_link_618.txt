ST. MAARTEN VACATION VILLAS RENTALS
BlueOceanVillas is your best choice for St Maarten or St Martin Vacation Villas Rentals. Saint Martin is an 37 square miles island shared by France and The Netherlands 190 miles east of Puerto Rico. It is 37 square miles of dry forested high hills and mountain peaks, low lying tropical rainforest, and beautiful white and red sand beaches. This is the smallest island in the world that is split between 2 countries.
Saint Martin is an overseas collectivity of France. Sint Maarten, the Dutch side of the island is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.This island is the only place on earth where France and The Netherlands share a border.
St Martin / St Maarten has a rich colorful culture affected by French, Dutch and other ethnicities. This eclectic culture and the island’s physical beauty are what has made the island a desired location for centuries. Caribbean, French, Dutch and other cultures have created an amazing wealth of cuisine, music, dance and style.
ST MAARTEN AMAZING DUTY FREE SHOPPING
Shopping abounds on both the Dutch and French sides of St Martin. The whole island is duty-free.
Many vendors accept US dollars in addition to the respective local currency. The French side (Saint Martin) uses the Euro as currency. Many places, particularly restaurants offer deals where one US dollar has the same value as one Euro. The French side has especially much to offer in respect to gourmet food, fine wines, world class perfumes, high-end cosmetics and designer clothes.
The Dutch side (St Maarten) has no local sales tax. The currency on the Dutch side is the Netherlands Antillean Guilder, but the US dollar is the most common used currency. Bargains can be found in Front and Back Street especially in jewelry, clothing and the latest electronics. Incidentally, electrical devices on the Dutch side use 110 Volt outlets where on the the French side they use 220 volts.
