Rachael Wood
Sales and Project Administrator
My primary role is to offer administrative support to the Sales and Project Delivery Teams, co-ordinating customers’ manufacturing, delivery and installation programs through our ERP system. Customers rely on me to take care of the detail – fortunately it’s one of my key strengths. Being methodical, reliable, and adaptable allows me to organise the breadth of requests and tasks involved.
I love working here because there’s a real family feel, all the team are flexible, approachable, friendly and happy to help.
