ANGEL MIR DOCK SHELTERS
The OSA dock shelters from Angel Mir – Portes Bisbal SL stand out for their resistance and because they meet all requirements thanks to the different models available, which can be adjustable, retractable and flexible. We have a dock shelter for every application!
When the vehicle arrives into the frame of the loading dock shelter, the flexible top and side curtains seal the air intake and/or the outer elements during the loading and unloading process. 
Thanks to their stable and reinforced structure, the dock seals are capable to withstand impacts and wear caused during the normal operation of the loading bay, and also potential tears that may arise from the wind movement. Furthermore, the pre-assembly system in the factory and the anchoring system to the structure make assembly and maintenance so much easier, with an average installation time of just 45 minutes for the AB Dock Shelter as the whole system is pre-mounted ready for fixing!

ANGEL MIR DOCK LEVELLERS
The OSA loading dock levellers from Angel Mir – Portes Bisbal SL have been developed to compensate the gap between the loading dock and the vehicle, and to allow the access of trolleys and pallet trucks.
They are simple and quick to install and, as they are manufactured in different standard sizes, they fit to any premises, always ensuring total safety. The front of the lip is bent and bevelled to allow a better adjustment on the vehicle floor. The whole top sheet has a non-slip coarse surface to make it easier for the movement of any vehicle.
The dock levellers for loading bays are characterized for having a very intuitive operation easy to learn and for being very strong; the structure is designed to withstand sporadic loads greater than the usual ones, and admits up to 100mm cross-slope of the vehicle.
They are carefully designed according to the different requirements of each project. They can be manufactured with various kind of finishes: powder painted steel, galvanized steel, stainless steel or the mixed version of stainless and galvanized steel. The choice of the kind of material will depend on the day-by-day use and the environment where they will be installed, for example, areas at risk of corrosion or the use of harsh cleaning products presenting oxidation risks.
