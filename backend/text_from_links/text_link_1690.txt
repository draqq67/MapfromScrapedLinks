Based in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, close to central London, I specialise in the bespoke design of logos, flyers, brochures, posters, business cards and stationery for clients big and small.
  I have the creativity, flexibility and knowledge to achieve an agency standard design but at very affordable prices. Not only that, but I can arrange the printing on your behalf and deliver directly to you for a truly end-to-end and hassle free service. I have a strong technical background in printing to make sure that your job is printed out just the way it was intended (often not the case!)
  I will work closely with you throughout the entire process to make sure you love the finished product.

Graphic Designer
The visual front door of you and your business, a strong logo requires no explanation.
LOGO DESIGN
BRANDING
A brand doesn't stop at a logo. When you are happy with your logo a strong brand needs to be built from business cards, letterheads and various promotional materials.
From a classic poster, leaflet, brochure or roller banner, to innovative, unique and imaginative marketing materials.
MARKETING
WEBSITES
A website connects you to the world and is an essential further reflection of your brand
“Thank you Sharon for really getting what it was I wanted in my design- you listened- hit the nail right on the head and turned the work around very efficiently. I couldn't recommend you more highly.”
