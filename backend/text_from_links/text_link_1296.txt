About us
The largest Network of European Protected Areas
We are the EUROPARC Federation and we represent hundreds of responsible authorities and thousands of Protected Areas in 40 countries. We often say in EUROPARC that nature knows no boundaries and we, therefore, facilitate international cooperation in all aspects of Protected Area management to improve and conserve our shared natural heritage.
Someone out there has the answer to your question, a solution to your problem, an idea you can use. So connect to the network!
We are really proud that EUROPARC is recognised around the world as a professional network of European Protected Areas providing a forum to share professional experience, collaborate on technical projects and progress common aims.
It’s great working with interesting people who look after unique places and we’d be delighted to welcome you to be a part of it! Hopefully, you’ll find out more as you explore our website! You can also follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn! 
We especially look forward to welcoming you in person at any one of our events or at our annual Conference.
