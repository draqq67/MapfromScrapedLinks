Testimonials
Thank you again for all the years of income, God has used you in a mighty way to help our family.
James Vanderschaaf, California
I am a Wife and Mother of two. My Daughter is 15 and my Son is 7. I am happy to finally experience a legitimate work from home position; that is flexible with my busy schedule. Even though I have had jobs where I worked partly from home and partly in the office. This is more flexible than anything I have done before!
Cicely Jackson, California
I have been married to my best friend for 19 years. We have a 31 year old, 26 year old, and 16 year old. I am a Phd. Student. I am in a wheelchair so working at home is perfect for my situation. So far it is a great experience!!
Dawn Quinn, Missouri
I am a single grandma to 3 and also in college again. I have been self-employed working out of my home for 30 years. Working with Daybreak Outsourcing offers me the opportunity to earn additional income, while still being self-employed. I love being able to choose when I will work. I look forward to a long and rewarding relationship with Daybreak Outsourcing.
Cheryl Forester, North Carolina
I'm a farm wife and mother to five children. I quit my job 9 years ago to homeschool my children. I needed something to supplement our income. Since I homeschool, I didn't want to work outside of the home. When I found Daybreak Outsourcing, I was unsure about this opportunity. I've done so many work from home things that never worked. I called back several times. Monica and her staff were so patient with all my questions. This has been the best experience for my family. Not only can I schedule the times that work best for my family, I enjoy working for my client and my children are enjoying the extra stuff we can do with the extra money. Thank you Daybreak Outsourcing!
Stacy Hall, Illinois
I am married with one child attending college at Marquette. I am excited to say this was my first real work from home assignment. What I love the most is the opportunity to choose your own hours and assisting customers. I would like to give Monica at Daybreak Outsourcing a big thank you! I would not have had this opportunity to work from home without her. Thank you Monica Tucker!
Celisa Murphy, Wisconsin
I am a widow with 2 children. I have been with Daybreak Outsourcing since April 2012. I love working from home. I am available to take my daughter to appointments and check in on my mom, in between hours that I work. Because I am disabled, working from home allows me the ability to attend appointments, as needed. Working from home, I don't have to worry about getting out in the bad weather to get to my job, I just have to step into my office and I am ready to go. I love working from home, and being associated with real companies, that have been around for a long time. This is a REAL job. I have over 15 years customer service and have never been happier!
