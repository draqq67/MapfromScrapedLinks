  Caring, Respectful Reiki Treatments & Classes Which
Honor Your Innate Dignity & Wisdom.
Reiki is a light touch therapy which was started in Japan in the early twentieth century by Mikao Usui.
Reiki is a very gentle subtle healing art which promotes balance in body, mind,
and spirit. Treatments are always done with great care and concern for
each individual client.
During a treatment, the practitioner lightly places his or her hands respectfully on various areas of the body.  Clients remain fully clothed, and practitioners can also position their hands a few inches above the body for those who are uncomfortable with light touch. While each treatment is unique, clients generally report feeling an improved sense of well-being along with a deep sense of support after a treatment.
Studies have shown Reiki to be effective in:
reducing pain
inducing relaxation response
reducing stress and anxiety
boosting the immune system
assisting patients after cardiac events
supporting clarity & decision making
supporting terminally ill patients and their families
helping to reduce side effects of medical treatments such as chemotherapy 
You do not have to adhere to any particular belief system for Reiki to be beneficial. 
Reiki is also an easily learned healing art that is now taught and practiced throughout the world.
