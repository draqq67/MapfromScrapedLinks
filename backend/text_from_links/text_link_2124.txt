Rosalind is one of the best photographers in the Home Counties! She is the consummate professional, fun and engaging. She produces top class results whilst putting subjects at ease in a lovely relaxed atmosphere. Her results are amazing and she captures moments spectacularly with ease. Very quick turn around post-shoot! Would recommend her for everything from portrait shoots to capturing live theatrical productions.
COVID-19 Precautions:

I am fully vaccinated and the studio is disinfected and cleaned between clients. I am not currently offering hot or cold beverages, but feel free to bring your own!
