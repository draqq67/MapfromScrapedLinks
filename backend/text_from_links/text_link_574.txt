"I obtained all of my ratings Private through CFII at Quantum Helicopters. I enjoyed the year-round flying conditions and the low cost of living in Chandler. Maintenance and safety are always the top priorities and scheduling a helicopter and instructor for training was always easy with plenty of helicopters available. Training standards are high and you will receive excellent training from all of the instructors on staff. If you are committed you can move at whatever pace you want and Quantum will be there to support you. After completing my training I was hired on as a CFI and gained lots of valuable experience."
