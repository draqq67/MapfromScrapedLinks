Working closely with organisations and agencies, we help to deliver a variety of communication services and bring high quality films, tailor-made to fit your company needs.
Using mediapool is cost effective, as we have minimal overheads and have a ratified pool of freelancers to call on when needed. Whether it’s working with our small in-house team, specialist programme-makers or budding new film talent from across the country, we find the right lineup with the expertise and creativity to suit your project requirements:
Media Consultants - to advise on all of your communication projects, with optional researchers to conduct feasibility studies.
Writer/Directors - with specialties covering healthcare, public sector, finance, transport, health & safety, news/current affairs, drama, animation and training.
Inhouse Facilities - four broadcast 4K camera kits, one mobile green screen studio, one multi-camera vision mixer, two mobile edit suites with a choice of DaVinci Resolve, Avid or Premiere Pro with After Effects, and one dedicated voiceover booth.
