Ecological Consultancy UK
We are Penny Anderson Associates Ltd, one of the leading ecological consultancies in the UK. We have been advising organisations on ecological issues since the 1970s and have built up a reputation of integrity and quality.
Over our long history, we have developed from a specialist ecological consultancy to cover broader aspects including soils, hydrology, geomorphology, geology, recreation, GIS, land management, sustainable drainage systems, water pollution and its remediation (especially using constructed wetlands), air pollution effects on vegetation and BREEAM.
We cover all aspects of biodiversity and, in the many impact assessments we undertake, have developed a good working knowledge of issues connected to cultural heritage, amenity, landscape and air pollution.
We work extensively in the commercial sector, but also regularly for Government Departments, Statutory Agencies and Local Authorities amongst others.
