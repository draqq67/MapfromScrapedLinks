 MISSION
The Aquarium & Shark Lab is focused on education, enrichment, and exploration of the ocean world.

Science, history, math, and culture are integrated into our exhibits and programs. Like the tide, we are in a continuous motion saying "Why not" and "What if" as our students and interns research ideas, document, and defy existing standards.

Loved this place. Very friendly staff of volunteers. Clear rules and lots of touching for young minds. Kids can spend an hour in here if they are the curious sort.
Took my ten year old granddaughter one rainy afternoon. We so enjoyed the friendly staff eager to answer questions and share information! Would recommend this for anyone interested in having a wonderful up close view of the fish!
There are lots of aquariums, touch pool, and people to help in this Main Street store front aquarium. Every time I have families with children visit this is a place I take them, and have never been disappointed.
