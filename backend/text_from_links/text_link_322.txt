In the early 1970’s, the property owners formed the
Sorrento East Property Owners Association aka SEPOA
The association carries out its functions through an elected board
and a number of committees, all of which are volunteers .
Members receive Information, Community News, Human Interest Stories, Virtual Annual Membership Directory, SEPOA Sponsored Events and may participate and vote in the Semi Annual and Annual Meeting.
Sorrento East is a quiet neighborhood of approximately 750 homes (a unique mix of single-family houses, villas, and condominium) located in Nokomis, Florida.  We are just off US 41, more commonly known as the Tamiami Trail, centrally located between Sarasota and Venice, Florida. This website offers information about our community for Property Owners, Members and those interested in living in our community.
