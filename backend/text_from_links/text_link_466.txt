A Summer of Fun,
A Lifetime of Memories
At Walden, you’re not just gaining an experience – you’re gaining a second home. And much like any other family, we will always encourage you to be yourself, to laugh and to be silly, and to be a part of all the fun! We want to help you to try new things, improve skills, make new friends, and create memories that will undoubtedly last a lifetime! We will take the absolute best care of you while also challenging you to help take care of those around you. When you are a part of the Walden family, you are a part of something much bigger, and you’re going to love how that feels.
Camp Walden is a co-ed overnight camp in the Adirondack Mountains in New York. We offer everything under the sun for summertime fun! From athletics, to arts, to aquatics, to adventure, Walden has it all. Fun is at the heart of a Walden summer and we incorporate it into all we do.
