Based in Teesside we provide service for the whole of the North East region and parts of Yorkshire.
Animal Story offer exceptional exotic animal workshops, exotic animal encounters and displays for everyone. Our talks encourage an interest in wildlife and the natural world around us. Most topics are linked to the National Curriculum and are perfect for children from the age of three upwards. All are educational, fun and packed full of animals. Why incur expensive travel costs when we can visit you?
