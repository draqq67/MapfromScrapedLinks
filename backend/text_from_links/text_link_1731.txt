AN AWARD WINNING COUNTRY INN NESTLED IN THE FOLD OF THE BEAUTIFUL SHIBDEN VALLEY, HALIFAX.
Having always been at the heart of Valley life, the 17th century Shibden Mill Inn was originally a corn and spinning mill, before being converted into a country pub in 1890.
Today’s visitors are welcomed with warm hospitality to enjoy first class dining against an inviting backdrop of open fires, low beamed ceilings and a cosy bar. Eleven individually styled bedrooms make comfortable and luxurious retreats, epitomising boutique country style and featuring lots of thoughtful touches.
If you can drag yourself away from the Inn, there are wonderful walks from the doorstep and world class attractions within easy reach. For a spot of retail therapy or a cultural fix, Halifax is a 10-minute drive and Leeds is just 30 minutes away.
