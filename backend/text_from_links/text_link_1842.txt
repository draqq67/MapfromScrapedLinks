Since we have started to work with Netmera, we feel like we are now capable of doing more than we could. We were already using Netmera for our push notification, pop-up and analytics needs to reach out to our 39.4 million subscribers. With this product, we can now set up feedback forms in a few minutes and collect instant feedback which allows us to gain insights, and take actions more freely and fast. We can have real-time data. Netmera also allows us to edit our campaigns whenever we want before publishing, and everything is editable. We feel more confident and free while working on our campaigns. Analyzing our campaigns is also easier and more measurable.
