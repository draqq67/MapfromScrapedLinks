One of the best lobster rolls I've ever had! Since I was born and raised in Maine I like to think that means something!

Love this place! We have been eating lobster rolls all over this summer and they for sure make one of the best! We love the grocery store part too and always find something unique to buy. They are also great if want to snag some lobsters for home. They cook them up for free so it makes for an easy dinner option. This is a place we will continue to frequent, an all around great spot in Scarborough.
