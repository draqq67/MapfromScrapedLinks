WHO WE ARE
RadioActive Promotions was set up in 2008 by Julie Barnes and Jessica Hall whose plugging partnership started in the early Noughties when they ran the highly successful regional department at award winning promotions company, Anglo Plugging. With offices in West London and Glasgow, RadioActive Promotions work with a wide range of clients from unsigned bands to major label artists.
With years of experience working within the indie/rock genres, the RadioActive Promotions roster reflects its founders’ tastes – loud guitars, classic songwriting and left field pop. Whether it is getting those first plays for a new emerging artist, or co-ordinating full blown campaigns for house-hold names, we work tirelessly to achieve results at regional radio. And as the company name suggests, we never stop sourcing new contacts from across commercial radio, local BBC, community radio, internet radio, in-store radio and student radio. .

WHAT OTHERS SAY
I’ve worked with Julie on a number of projects now and I can’t recommend her highly enough. Her understanding of the artists she works with coupled with her experience and relationships means she delivers a truly bespoke campaign every time. Nothing is by numbers. She really knows her stuff and I trust her completely – as do her contacts and most importantly the artists. On top of that she’s warm, honest and funny and an absolute joy to be around.
Christina Skinner
VP Of Radio Promotion Parlophone Music
Thorough, timely, doggedly persistent with clear & regular reporting. RadioActive are an essential part of any promo campaign!
Nick Bray
Promotions Director - International, Red Bull Records
I’ve known Jess and Julie for nearly 15 years, working alongside them to help promote all kinds of bands. I believe that they are amongst the most proactive and passionate pluggers in the industry – only ever dealing with artists that they believe in, which for me is so important as I know that whenever I receive music from them it will always be appropriate and of the highest quality.”
Loz Guest
Head of Music @ Kerrang! Radio & Planet Rock
“We work with Radioactive across the majority of our roster and are never disappointed. Jess is always engaged and passionate and is truly considered part of the Rise Records family.”
Clare Maxwell
Rise Records / BMG
“I know I’m in good hands with RadioActive Promotions and that my records will get played in the right places and I’ll be doing the right promo that matters.”
Paul Weller
“RadioActive is quite simply organised, results-driven, communicative and their reports are excellent. Pretty much all you can ask for in a regional radio plugging company.”
Kate Hendry
Label Manager at Absolute Marketing
“Julie is like a high grade terrier who sets to work on achieving the best results possible however easy or however daunting the challenge. She’s great at convincing the more precious and more art leaning clients to dig in and do the necessary promo and superb at convincing doubting programmers of why they should be playing a record. First class conscientious service.”
Ted Cockle
President of Virgin EMI
“RadioActive Promotions are a massively important part of our team, I know how hard our records are worked regionally and what strong relationships they have at radio. Our tracks are played on all the right stations and RadioActive Promotions don’t give up until they get the playlist they want. When we are in full promotional mode, I know that what RadioActive Promotions asks of Paul really will make a difference to the album or single”
