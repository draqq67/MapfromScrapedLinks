“We’ve had a great experience purchasing our puppy from Haus Amberg Shepherds. He is a very loveable, sweet, healthy puppy, and we are so glad we went on Haus Amberg Shepherds and found him. Patrick and Alishia are amazing breeders. They know everything about their dogs and help you with all their heart choosing the right puppy that perfectly matches with your desire. I would certainly recommend them to others. So without any doubt, they deserve definitely 5 stars! Greetings from Belgium.”
