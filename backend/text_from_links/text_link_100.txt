ABOUT US
Welcome to The Grind
 If you crave real food and great coffee, you’ll love knowing that we provide a great alternative to chains with handcrafted coffee and espresso drinks and wide range of house-made breakfast and lunch options. 

We are proud to be a local and independent small business- owned and operated by  Westchase residents 
(no franchise or corporate owners in sight). 


Real food from scratch
Our Cafe delivers way beyond the traditional coffee shop favorites.  Enjoy a full menu of breakfast choices, including eggs, omelettes, pancakes, and plenty of healthy options (including gluten free and vegetarian)

Be sure to check out our weekend specials, where we go all out to provide you with options that are delicious and different.   

And for lunch-lovers, we serve a wide variety of salads,  sandwiches and flatbreads- all  made in house.
WE'RE HIRING!
