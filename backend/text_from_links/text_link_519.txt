IQ Fitness - Where Mind Meets Muscle
At IQ Fitness, mind meets muscle. We believe that an exercise program should not only be fun, but also that it should be done safely, that it should be informed by the most accurate and up-to-date research in exercise science, and that it should focus on being functional, that is, it should make everyday life easier and more enjoyable.
Knowledge is Power
The first step toward achieving your fitness goals begins with the Individual Assessment. On Day 1, one of IQ Fitness' Degreed and Experienced Trainers will meet with you to evaluate your fitness level and unique needs, and to discuss your personal fitness goals. With this knowledge in hand, we then map out a fitness program and a nutritional plan that will enable you to see results quickly.
