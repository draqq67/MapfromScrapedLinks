Responsive & creative staff delivered my personalized logo mugs on time and on budget.   The finished product is outstanding and  it was so popular I had to double my order.    I wanted to meet the staff and owner so I picked up my order at their workshop\warehouse in the west loop and got a quick tour of their shop.   I was so pleased to see their cool operations.  However, they will ship or deliver as well, whatever works for the customer.   Staff were nice and appeared genuinely concerned that I loved my order.     100% recommend!

I highly recommend Lucky Prints. They have completed multiple bulk orders for my company and the finished product has always come in exactly as I ordered, and very high quality. Not to mention, the staff was extremely helpful when it came to the design and placement. Definitely call Lucky Prints if you are looking for a pro printing company!

Great experience working with Luckyprints! Our small daycare business made sweatshirts and ts for our teachers and they turned out beautifully. Mac and the team made the whole process so easy, and the turnaround time was very quick. Would highly recommend!

I recently had the pleasure of working with Luckyprints for a project for my residential and commercial cleaning service, The Clean Junkie, and I cannot praise them enough for their outstanding customer service and exceptional product quality. From the very beginning, their team was attentive, patient, and genuinely enthusiastic about bringing my vision to life.The experience with Luckyprints was nothing short of remarkable. They went above and beyond to ensure every detail was met, making the entire process smooth and enjoyable. Their communication was prompt and courteous, addressing all my queries and providing valuable suggestions to enhance the final product.When I finally received The Clean Junkie prints, I was beyond elated. Their printing company perfectly captured my vision, and I couldn't help but burst out in tears of joy. The attention to detail and the quality of the prints were unparalleled, exceeding all my expectations.I highly recommend Luckyprints to anyone seeking top-notch printing services. Their dedication to customer satisfaction and the ability to turn your vision into reality is truly commendable. Thank you, Curt + Luckyprints team, for making The Clean Junkie project a memorable and emotional success!

I was referred to Luckyprints by the Mokena Chamber of Commerce.  Curt was communicative and accommodating throughout the entire process.  In addition to the print job being very well done, they did some rework on our logo, which turned out               AWESOME!  Return customer, for sure!

LuckyPrints made amazing drink koozies on quick turnaround for my friend‚Äôs 40th birthday party. They were easy to work with and the results were perfect.

I can't say enough good things about Luckyprints! I'm starting my own clothing brand as a part of the initial process I reached out to many of the garment printers in the Chicago area. It was clear from the start that Luckyprints has amazing customer service and competitive rates - they helped me find the right garment I needed and walked me through the whole process. The final hoodies I picked up were even better than I envisioned - they're high quality and done right - shoutout to Logan for all the help as well. I plan on using Luckyprints for all my projects moving forward!

I am a business owner that was looking to get some custom shirts done. After many hours of calling other businesses and supply chain frustrations, I called Logan at Luckyprints and found some serenity! I laid everything out on the table and she was communicative, professional, and honest. We found that a solution that worked best and I'm jazzed about the results. They even got my order ready a few days before the estimated date, which is always appreciated. Thank you Logan and Luckyprints!!

I got some embroidered beanies for a bachelorette party and they were incredible to work with! Extremely responsive and on time even though my order was probably a lot smaller than their usual. Very friendly,  professional and helpful communication. Pickup was easy and quick. The beanies themselves were high quality and the embroidery looked amazing. Would definitely recommend to anyone!

I would give six stars if I could!  Communication, turnaround, cost, and going above and beyond are just some of the things I can say Luckprints does well.  As a small business owner I can attest to how difficult things can be right now with staffing, supply, etc. and they still delivered exemplary service.  Thank you again Luckyprints for being great!

Luckyprints is a great company to work with. I appreciate the range and quality of tee shirts to choose from.  The applications turned out great for both shirts I designed and ordered from Luckyprints!

Luckyprints has a fast turnaround, excellent customer service, and a great product! We ordered bulk screen printed t-shirts, which were ready on-time and beautiful. Would strongly suggest going in-person to review fabric and design layout and pick out paint colors as these vary from digital image to fabric - we did that and it made all the difference. A great company!

I really love Ozzy and the rest of the team. They have been such a pleasure to work with. I just started a clothing line and recently moved to Chicago- so finding them right when I moved here was meant to be. The quality of the prints have been great and everyone loves the black gloss on black tanks! We also ended up ordering some sweatshirts that we later decided to not go forward with and they credited the money back to us for a future Luckyprints order- that is what I call caring about your customers- they truly do! I am looking forward to our continual partnership üôÇ
