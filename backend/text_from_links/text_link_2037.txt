The Future Of Your Executive Search Business
This is what we do will cover when we speak.

1. Niche - we must know who the client is. Who the candidate is.
2. Opportunity - we must know the 'exact' number of companies, clients, candidates in that niche.
3. Traction - we must know the fee we will charge x no of placements to hit our first milestone.
4. USP - we must know our competition, their approach, their weaknesses and crush them.
5. Simplify - we must simplify our business into Step 1 Leads > Step 2 Convert > Step 3 Deliver
6. Apply - layman’s terms - daily client leads, convert and deliver the candidate.
7. Delegate - Virtual assistants to create the leads and candidates. Account Managers to manage candidate process.

Then It Takes a Proven Path to Scale Your New Improved Executive Search Business and Income.

8. Role - Your role will change into Project Manager then Leader. Not easy as its your baby however this is where the scale leaps. You'll have a cr*p few months then Boom!
9. Clients - Only you can speak to clients right. Yes, I know. However, if we can 10x the leads and roles could you test my process and bring on board an Account Manager or Commission Only Recruiter. I'll even bet you this works.
10. Authority - Fancy being no1 on iTunes? Getting paid to speak at events in your industry? I have the paint by numbers strategies, the proof. You need the authority, so the business is the hero - not you - otherwise you are stuck in a job where it’s always through you.
11. Strategy 1 - Low End Volume - you have a business now that has ok fees and ok clients. Scale that with automation and we handover to a VA and a COR.
12. Strategy 2 - High End Fees - you can get roles at 10x to 25x the fees you get now. You have no model for it and your voice inside says you can't. When we speak, I will give you real life people you can google and see you are sitting on a mountain of revenue.
13. 3 Year Plan - you have two businesses - a low end and a high-end client and matching set of candidates - you just don't know t yet. You are in the bottle, and you can't read the label.
14. Asset - build this to sell or build this as a cash machine?

I can't play football well. However I can tell you that if you are angry at where you are know the old model is screwed. I can help. Even gaurantee it.
