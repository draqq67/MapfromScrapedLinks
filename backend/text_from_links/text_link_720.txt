-Anthony Bourdain
“Las Vegas is bolstering it’s reputation as one of the world’s great culinary cities not for the superstar chefs, but for it’s smaller “hidden gem” restaurants. The Bootlegger Bistro is a historic Las Vegas landmark. Chef Maria Perry and her husband Al Perry started the legacy in 1949 when they opened their first small restaurant in Las Vegas, serving the legends of Hollywood and Las Vegas including Howard Hughes, Frank Sinatra, Liberace, Elvis Presley and many others.”
