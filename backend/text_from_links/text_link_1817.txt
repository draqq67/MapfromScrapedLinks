Supporting 6,000 people into employment.
Since 2018, we have supported 16,000 people in Lanarkshire and Tayside to find work with 6,000 into successful employment. As of 31 March 2024, we are no longer taking new referrals. If you are already on this programme, we are here for you and will continue to provide support until 31 March 2025. If you need employment support, contact your local services.

We have helped people to:
Overcome challenges
including access to mental health and debt advice
Build their skills and confidence

Find the right job for them
