Founded in the heart of Austria in 2006, Lehnen make aggressive and beautiful rock music. Their last two releases, "I See Your Shadow" (2013) and "Reaching Over Ice and Waves" (2015), saw the band share stages with the likes of Russian Circles, Boris, Junius, Tides from Nebula, Pillars, and Pray for Sound, while touring with bands such as Caspian and InAeona.
The fear of failing keeps many living in unwanted patterns. In an increasingly digital world, that is simultaneously connected and disconnected, we often struggle to find our place in the bigger picture. In the face of social constructs and expectations, time draws on. Regardless of whether we change or accept our fate, the slate can never truly be wiped clean. However, we can choose how to fill the remaining space.
With roaring, caustic distortion, and calming ambience, Lehnen’s fifth studio album, "Negative Space", explores these concepts without pulling any punches - or giving many answers. Rather, it raises questions and peers into the abyss of depression, if only to proclaim that no one has to feel alone.
"Negative Space" is out via Noise Appeal Records (EU) and Post. Recordings (USA) on September 17th, 2021.
