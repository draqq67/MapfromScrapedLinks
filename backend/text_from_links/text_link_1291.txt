Large Storage
At Tuta you get 1 GB of email storage for your messages and attachments right from the start with any free account. This is double the 500 MB you start with at other free encrypted email services, and our free accounts include all security-relevant features. At the same time, most privacy-friendly email providers only offer paid accounts, no free plan. Our mission at Tuta is that everyone must be able to switch to a privacy-first email alternative and create a secure email address. This is why the basic free account in Tuta will remain free forever. On top of that, all data is stored securely in Germany.

Your data, your rules
Everyone deserves privacy, security and control over their data. That‚Äôs why even our free email account and calendar app are ad-free and end-to-end encrypted. Find out more about why privacy matters.
Why do you need more email security?
Are you finding yourself targeted by oddly specific ads and wondering ‚Äûhow on earth did they know to show me that?‚Äù. If you are privacy-savvy, you‚Äôve probably found yourself having to disable permissions again and again in your device‚Äôs privacy and security settings, after a system update, even though your operating system doesn‚Äôt have a problem retaining other types of data during the updating process. It‚Äôs obvious: your activity is being tracked intentionally. From your operating system, to your browser, to sites and apps that you use and user accounts that you need to create on many of these, at every step there is data collected about you. Some of it is meant to improve the functionality of these services. A lot of it is meant to make it easier for companies to market to you.
Tracking via Gmail
Additionally, the types of activity that Google tracks is even more encompassing across devices and operating systems when you have a Gmail address and you use it to create accounts for various services - even if you‚Äôre not using Google‚Äôs Chrome browser. Are you getting email newsletters, special offers or political fundraising calls that you never signed up for? This is a given, whether you‚Äôre using a social platform, shopping online, signing a petition, donating to a cause you care about or signing up for a different newsletter that you‚Äôre actually interested in, or any other activity that requires you to provide an email address.
People who are less tech-savvy or part of age groups with less experience navigating the internet tend to leave even more breadcrumbs and are usually more susceptible to ads, fake news and other types of manipulation. It‚Äôs not just commercial messaging that targets you based on your digital profile, but even news and entertainment content. This digital profile is put together from data gathered by most of the tech companies whose products you use and then sold to and by data brokers.
Data brokers include credit reporting companies, people-finding websites, and many analytics and marketing companies. They operate in a sprawling, unregulated ecosystem and are rightfully being called "the middlemen of surveillance capitalism". They‚Äôre a multi-billion dollar industry with a lack of transparency and accountability, with an FTC report concluding that they "collect consumers‚Äô personal information and resell or share that information with others". But the fact that it‚Äôs a well-known problem doesn‚Äôt make it easy to regulate away, with Big Tech companies opposing anti-trust legislation, even by posing as grass-roots groups.
Create a secure email account with Tuta - as your primary email and for your user profiles on apps and sites - and you will make it more difficult for data brokers to aggregate data about you. What‚Äôs more, the alias feature included with all our paid accounts helps you quickly deactivate alias email addresses that start getting unwanted emails.
Just like with social media platforms, with most email services free email isn‚Äôt really free. You already know this because of the cross-platform ads that you get served: Your attention is the product.

SECURE PERSONAL EMAIL
SECURE BUSINESS EMAIL
Privacy is in our DNA
More and more people are prioritizing privacy. Businesses are increasingly concerned with cloud security and other digital security issues. At the same time, an increasing number of consumers say "businesses should be doing more to actively protect their data" and they report feeling "concerned, confused" and a "lack of control over their personal information". About 6 in 10 adults "think their personal data is less secure now, that data collection poses more risks than benefits, and believe it is not possible to go through daily life without being tracked" by either companies or government or both. And they are not wrong.
But this is not how the internet was meant to work and it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. It is our mission to make it better and this is what drives every feature at Tuta.
Privacy means freedom of speech and freedom of thought. But it also means refusing to have your behavior commodified by surveillance capitalists and it means safety from exploitation, manipulation and doxxing.
Best private email
At Tuta, we believe that business models based on data collection and data exploitation must be stopped. We fight for a different internet. One where privacy by design is the foundation.
We understand the importance of private email communications, where your personal information remains confidential and protected. We believe that everyone should have the ability to communicate securely and maintain their privacy online. That's why our private email service is designed with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only you and the intended recipient can access the contents of your messages. We never compromise on privacy and do not track or sell your data. With Tuta, you can enjoy the convenience of email while maintaining the security of your private information. Whether you're an individual or a business, Tuta provides the best platform for secure and private communication.
Being able to sign up for email without a phone number is a great first step. But even privacy-focused apps typically use Google Push and Google reCAPTCHA. At Tuta, even our free encrypted email on Android does not rely on Google, but uses our own push notification service and our own open-source CAPTCHA. Furthermore Tuta‚Äôs secure password reset and innovative search on encrypted data are additional features that ensure that not even we can gain access to your data. At the same time, paid accounts come with many more benefits on top, making Tuta the best email service all-around.
Tuta is a freemium email service with a business model sustained by people who value their right to privacy enough to upgrade their account to a paid subscription. In return, they benefit from a lot of extra features as Premium, Teams or Pro users.
Explore all the features and price plans.
Freedom Fighters

Support Tuta and help us build the Internet of the future: private and secure! Together we will stop mass surveillance with built-in encryption.

What makes Tuta Mail better than Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, Zoho
and other conventional email services:
We don‚Äôt collect and share your data. We never serve you ads or try to guide your app usage in a way that would serve us. Security and privacy are your default with Tuta, not a long & complex process like trying to get end-to-end encryption set up with a typical email client or adjust the privacy settings to your own priorities.
What makes Tuta better than ProtonMail, FastMail, HushMail
and other encrypted email services:
We provide more thorough encryption than any other provider. In comparison with Proton Mail we protect much more data with end-to-end encryption, including subject lines, entire address book, calendar meta-data. Our business accounts are easy to migrate to and include more security features than any other email or calendar service. We don‚Äôt rely on integrations with Google services, unlike our competitors. With Tuta, you get the biggest bang for your buck, with the most features included with a free account and the lowest price points for paid accounts. All paid accounts include support for your custom domain with which you can create as many email addresses as you need.
Our Team sets us apart, too: Our founders have a long track record of fighting for data independence and privacy rights. We own the company, so we don‚Äôt need to prioritize making profits for shareholders at the expense of our users‚Äô best interests, like other companies often do. We own our infrastructure and share with you our Transparency report and every Privacy policy detail.
