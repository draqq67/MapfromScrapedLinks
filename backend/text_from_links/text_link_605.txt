SKILLS
Motion Design
As a Motion Designer, I merge traditional graphic design with animation and visual effects to bring mesmerizing graphics to life in video productions for film, the web and television. I use different cinematic techniques to bring concepts to life in 2D and 3D formats. I am profIcient in Adobe After Effects and Maxon Cinema 4D.
Art Direction
As an Art Director I am often the mastermind behind the aesthetic of any project, leading teams of animators and illustrators to execute the details of the creative concept and bring it to life. From determining which artistic elements to use, to developing budgets and timelines, I am proficient at crafting a unique and powerful aesthetic.
Video Editing
As a Video Editor I work closely with directors to achieve the best final outcome on screen, with the goal of telling the story in the most effective and compelling way. Using Adobe Premiere Pro, I am skilled at cutting and rearranging scenes, as well as deciding angles and points of view, and incorporating special effects in post-production.
UI Design
As a UI designer I'm responsible for the aesthetics of a website, ensuring that users find it attractive, intuitive and natural. I strive to perfect the tiniest of details on a website: color palettes, font pairings, images, forms, menus, hover-triggered animations, buttons, and more. I constantly research trends, industry analysis and web design principles to create an interface that users are comfortable and confident using.
ABOUT ME
I'm James Surdam, an art director with a strong background in motion graphics and a special interest in using animation for documentary and news reporting. I excel at leading and guiding teams to create visually stunning and compelling motion graphics that tell stories and engage audiences. In my free time, I love exploring nature with a a pair of On running shoes or my Sony camera. My portfolio showcases a diverse range of animation styles and I'm always experimenting with new techniques and technologies to push the boundaries of motion graphics. Let's create something amazing together.
