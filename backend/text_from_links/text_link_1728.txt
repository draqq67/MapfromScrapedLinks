Hello, we're DigiBee...
…and we believe in producing innovative and creative technology solutions. Our passion is in programming, application development, web analytics and digital marketing.
About
We’re an innovative, creative, technology-solutions provider specialising in programming, application development, web analytics and digital marketing.
We started in 2008 and have grown steadily since – employing experts in PPC, e-commerce, social media, analytics, web development, engineering and much, much more.
Naturally, as we’re a tech company, most of us are self-confessed geeks. But we do have a human side too: marketing guru with a mugs-in-the-cupboard-must-all-face-the-same-way obsession?
Check. Pen-stealing operations manager? Check. We’ve got them all.
Even though we do say so ourselves, DigiBee is a fantastic place to work and we love the fact that no two days are the same (except Saturday and Sunday when not much happens).
