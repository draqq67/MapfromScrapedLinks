WHAT 
WE DO
Parents often feel overwhelmed when faced with their child’s diagnosis. Parents also often don’t know how to access resources or they may need support navigating their child’s services. MHP provides Resource Coordination for families and professionals supporting special children. MHP is not a hotline, but rather walks families through their journey.
In addition, MHP has a particular specialty in helping families navigate their child’s educational supports in a public school setting. MHP is the only entity on the East Coast that provides IEP expert advice on a no cost to the family basis.
