Welcome to IFW Dresden
We explore the physics and chemistry of new materials. Our aim is to generate new fundamental knowledge and innovations. New materials are necessary to store information in a better way and to transmit it faster, to filter waves of specific frequency, to shield magnetic fields, to convert heat into electricity or to store energy. These processes take place at the level of molecules, atoms and electrons and are determined by the laws of quantum physics. At IFW Dresden, we investigate these physical laws and develop materials with better or completely new functions.
